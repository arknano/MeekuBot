254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's ridonk price for a pedestal fan
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	faster doesn't equal better if you're just trying to cool a room

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	if building new, might consider it though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not having a kettle might be fun
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	I have but my problem is mother overpacks the fridge so little space.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have like an 8L cask in the fridge
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ah, other people

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but sometimes it's empty and also it takes a few hours to chill when filled up

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also filling it up is a pain in the ass unless the sink is empty (it is not)
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	get one o them freezy cups
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they're awesome

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah huge tank in the fridge seems inefficient
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	two water bottles

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since i'd have to do that with normal water bottles and sodastream bottles
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we got a chilled tap at work and its so easy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what if
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i get a freestanding chilled water dispenser
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	those are way cheaper and i don't own the house anyway
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	I miss working in a office space to have water cooler talk
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Good times

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	What is lean manufacturing?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fuckennnn improving shit, wasting less time and money
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but more importantly than anything else
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	TELLING EVERYONE THAT YOU'VE IMPROVED SHIT
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they cannot seem to stress this enough
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	any time you improve something TAKE PICTURES, WRITE POINTLESS CHARTS, PAT YOURSELF ON THE BACK BUT MAKE SURE EVERYONE SEES YOU DO IT
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	if I don't fill out some huge shit forms and take before and after photos, did I even do anything?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Oh man yeah nice, get bogged down doing work about work
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	It's what my whole org does dw
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	make sure everything is in a central spot, not where you need it because that's messy, but also make sure it's right where you need it because walking to get things is wasting time = wasting money
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	god I hate this shit so much
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I love how there's legit academics like "this is the best way to office/factory/etc" and managers throw that all away and click one of the first few google results and send it $x0000
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	KPIS BRO HOW CAN YOU IMPROVE  WITHOUT MICROMANAGEMENT!!!
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Legit!! And it‚Äôs because the conclusion is ‚Äútrust workers and give them respect and autonomy to do their tasks‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	which seems like whooaaa Nellie if we do that then they‚Äôll overthrow us and burn down the factory
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but really they‚Äôll just do their jobs better with less stress
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Mood lighting is a big one at my office
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Reception and the main meeting room look like opium dens
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yick no thanks
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	anyway better get back for another 16 hours bye

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Immediately as I posted that I realised
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That's exactly why I got a handwritten note
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Beauty and grace

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	downside, you didn‚Äôt get that sleep and when it wears off the fatigue is crushing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	upside, the dose takes 24 hrs to wear off
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea would rather attack the sleep problem haha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Tru that is a good place to start

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I think I exacerbated it by getting jumped up on sugar to help me thru

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I barely dream at all lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	As if, I dream vividly as soon as I fall asleep almost every time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And yea unlike the randoms of radelaide discord I don't really care about getting doxxed by you guys lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	How did you find out han
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And same I only dream when I wake up and fall back asleep

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	There was a Twitter involved I remember that had the key elements, and then linked to some guys game dev website where he listed full names involved
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I can‚Äôt remember exactly it was months ago when I was curious one day
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But it only took one try of solidly snooping haha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	then again research is my career so I‚Äôm good at it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea you can probably Google Sean Adelaide gamedev and find me tbf haha

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	would definitely end up smooth af

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So i can listen after work
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Haha I am trying to remember the one song I know
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's going better than I expected
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	After 30 mins I can play one section poorly again :deepfriedcrylaughing:
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Rugrats theme?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	my magnum opus
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	recorded on my phone with a fan blowing directly on it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	pretty hard to play the scat one since the sound is based on velocity and you have to thump it to get anything but dooos
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think with the app i can connect to the piano and change the velocity curves to make it easier though

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i just watched a loopy boye and a chuo rapid arrive and depart a station perfectly in sync
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	absolutely fucking fascinating
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Now I'm imagining commuter trains doing loop-the-loops

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So much room for activities
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I actually couldn't play this track properly on my old MIDI keyboard because it went down to a low octave at the end
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I was trying to do an octave shift but it was too hard hahaha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	bruh I‚Äôm so jealous
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	actually no I‚Äôm envious
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	damn
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Stupid werds. I can never remember which is which
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So i just use jelly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the action is really nice too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't play real pianos very often but this definitely feels like hammer on strings
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh and the keys have an ivory texture haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Definitely jelly. I only ever had a cheap elec organ at home. No weighting or variation. I was always envious of folks with real pianos.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Blew my mind when I found out you could get keyboards that faked it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea digital pianos have come a long way
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	A new music place recently opened just down the road from work. You're making me want to go check it out and see what things cost
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Software's probably a consideration too I guess
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Oh yeah and not being able to play :P
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you don't need software for an electric piano
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you need software for a midi piano, but there's very few midi pianos with fully weighted keys
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	electric pianos are also midi pianos tho
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	>:(
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I want both
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea if you wanna play standalone you need an electric piano
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which are a lot more spendy haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	What type of graphics card that i can't get in the current market level of spenny we talking
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the 3 main categories are midi keyboards (midi only, no onboard), synth keyboards (like every kid in the 80s and 90s had, onboard synthesiser, midi), and electronic/digital pianos (built to replicate the feel of an actual piano, onboard synthesiser, midi)
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	way cheaper than a gpu haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	mine was 700 bucks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	cheaper than a "good" gpu
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	And what's yours?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	In that list of types
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	latter
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	midi keyboards and synth keyboards usually use just "keyboard" keys, which are just the springed keys you've surely used before
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	some of them have what they called "semi-weighted" which gives them a buckling action similar to the feel of an actual piano but it's pretty far off
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	feels similar to tactile (not clicky) mechanical keyswitches
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Do they still have variable volume based on strike?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea it would be pretty hard to find a keyboard without velocity sensitivity
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ok
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i mean outside of the toy section
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the cat keyboard doesn't have velocity üòÑ
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Full-on realistic weighting might be unnecessary for me who has little to compare to
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Why am i looking into this
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hahaha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Don't need peeno
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Don't need camera
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea same tbh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i didn't get any guilt today so i think good purchase
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I've been thinking about it for the last 15 years
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i reckon you should just buy a keyboard on facebook and mess around with it to see if you're at all interested
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i only bought this thing after getting frustrated on my midi keyboard
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I couldn't justify it when i had a huge organ sitting in the spare room never getting used
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	But a keyboard at least wouldn't take up heaps of space while being neglected
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	(The organ has been moved on as of last year)
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Aaaanyway
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	go to the music store and hit keys
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah might do ay
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Go for a wander, then use the excuse of didn't being the car to make sure I don't buy anything
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Bring
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hahaha derringers won't let you get away with it

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Oh dang

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Unsure tbh my piano has real pedals and I think U need a nice one for proper sustain
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	is it supposed to be analog?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or is it just on or off
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I don‚Äôt know tbh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	wait
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Pedals are always on
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	You push them and they modify ur noise
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I can‚Äôt turn off my pedals
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they‚Äôre part of the piano
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	damper pedal, sustain, and a timbre hollow one
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Just like a real piano
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no as in
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	is the sustain pedal supposed to be all sustain or no sustain
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or are you supposed to be able to do degrees between that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im looking at keyboard stands and
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they put a keytar stand in the category
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oh yeah it depends on your touch
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	like a gas pedal in a car
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	actually it‚Äôs almost exactly the same
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Watch concert pianists they basically stroke it with their foot sometimes and then sometimes flatten it and release fast for the drama
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	tbh all piano playing questions I feel like can answered by watching professionals they‚Äôre just so good
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But definitely yes this

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what gives me depression is a student describing mass effect as a hack n slash

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yes and its not a hack n slash by any definition of the term

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But I was interested in the world
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It does get more interesting but the storytelling remains...
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Lethargic?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Once you start learning more about the RAPs and what the whole thing is about I started finding it hard to put down
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	There's a bunch of familial drama that drags it down a bunch though
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	dammmmn ok family drama im out
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	if its got cool worldbuilding im down but
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	its gotta be realy cool
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	to balance that out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I'll let you know of the slow burn was worth it when I finish s3
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	oh good taking one for the team
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i'm watching ALTER horror shorts on youtube
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they're pretty good i like how they're √°ll done by dif countries so all the actors have random accents
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Do I wanna watch colony
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	For the 'after star trek' list
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It got quite interesting in season 3 but it's also not really what's on the tin any more
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Not a bad thing necessarily just very different to the first season
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Google photos made this amazing video of slempy boye
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Omfg

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I think it might be a Thermomix or equivalent?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	RAIN
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	All my laundry is hanging outside

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I went to the shops
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	spent no money üëç
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Ooo and got a number hey Paul how u doin
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	So me and Ms Sigil went to a primary school tour this morning cuz our eldest is nearing the age to  start going to proper school. Starts off with a boring-ass presso talking about their values and it sounds so empty, that's standard, and the guy presenting is a bit of a douche, whatever. Later we're actually doing the tour and it's these two kids showing us around, they're nice, Ms Sigil asks if they've ever been bullied and one says yeah, standard so far. Afterwards Ms S asks one of the administration people who were at the presso what do they do if someone is bullied and the woman says "that doesn't happen here". That is a BOLD statement, you guys 700+ kids and there's *no* bullying? Ms S expresses doubt and the woman comes back with "we don't allow it because we don't want to be seen as having a problem with bullying."
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	That's like, the Catholic church defense
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Dear god
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Also you're saying the quiet part out loud lady
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	pfff kids or not, there's always bullying. adult workplaces. bullying. it's always there
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	No kids or stakes advice: do not put her in that school lmao
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yeah it's gonna be a no from us dawg
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Omg schnook just saw ur pfp it‚Äôs alvins ball I couldn‚Äôt figure out why it was so familiar
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the first part of fixing a problem is admitting there's a problem
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That‚Äôs really...damn though and she said that to parents looking to actually enroll their child
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	silly person
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not to say that other people at the school *don't* necessarily do a good job of dealing with bullying, but she's not being a good representative by head-in-the-sanding
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yeah it was a major Bruh moment
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	:bruh:
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Wow good work asking the right questions lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	That's insane I wonder if she heard herself
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Probably not
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yeah she was 100% not self aware
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Noice
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I bought a piano book today
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	as in sheet music?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm leaning toward the FP10 too. Seems like the best choice for me being a beginner but still wanting nice pianoey feeling and also relatively compact.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	All in one learning thing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Theory prac and sheet music
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh interesting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I'm loving the fp10
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You saw it in person so you won't get the mild shock I did
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It was a lot taller than I expected
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Coming from synth keyboards and midi keyboards
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I have no preconceptions at this point, having never had anything to do with them
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and I don't even remember which one it was in the shop
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Fp10 and 30 are basically identical in looks
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	didn't really try anything out myself, since I can't play anything üò£
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You bashed keys though right
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah 30 has a few more buttons
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	timidly, a little, yes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they felt pianoey
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	gotta see if billy hyde will price match derringers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea derringers is cheapest I found
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Make sure you have a home for it though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You might want to include the cost of a stand
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah will need a stand
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	There's one designed specifically for it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	storage space is easy so long as I can sit it end-on
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I'm thinking of getting an X stand
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah nah I'll get an X
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not leaving this thing out as a permanent fixture
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Conversation starter
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Ah yes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I dabble in the ivory arts
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	üòÇ important note
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	kawai organs only has one i
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's some fun google image search
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this is very close to the one I had up until last year
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sounds like shit ay
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Sounds like an organ haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I can't remember the model of mine, but I remember searching it and having several sources say things like "worst kawai organ ever made" and "$10 isn't a bargain unless it's $10 to take it away"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I guess that's why we had it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	no way the olds dropping piano money for my sister practice for like 2 years then give it up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I still enjoyed it though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Kawai E60 apparently
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Hah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So we had graduation tonight

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I don't know any of the graduating students
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Still had to wear full gown and mortarboard
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Handsome

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Didn't like it when I graduated either
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	On the plus side the CEO(s) were in so we had comped dinner and a tab
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	wait you weren't graduating but had to wear the getup?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea teachers wear it too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	lame
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You woulda loved it jugs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	In the CEO's address he used an anecdote like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	We have a saying in this family when we take a loss
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	How many Ferraris was that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Oh that was a 2 Ferrari loss
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	To an audience of kids with fresh government debts
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	:sweat2:

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Like how did that come up
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	How did you not throw a chair
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	btw graf if I buy this thing fair warning I'll be asking you lots of stupid questions about the computer end of it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Haha sure
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I haven't plugged mine in yet
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Just talking about his history. He's big money from stuff other than the school
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But since we're non profit I bet it's great for tax
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The decompression chicken

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haha wow you actually bought it?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I did do
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	üí∏
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm *stimulating the economy*
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Much stimmy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	FP10 or?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah 10
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	piano twinsies
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	wew!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's an app piano partner
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which will allow you to access all the other sounds
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah I heard that's a thing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its pretty neat you can add more reverb and stuff
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	weird choice imo, but I guess that's how force people onto your app
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it has some sheet music and play along functionality too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it can also "record" you playing but it's very weird
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it records the midi data and then plays back via the piano
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	only seems to work with the default piano sound
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I wish they'd make these things compy compatible
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I don't want to use my stupid phone for this shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think the intent is a tablet
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah not buying one of those
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ios in particular has *a lot* of music related stuff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but yea the jazz scat sound is on the physical keys so you got everything you need
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah most of what I've seen has been apple stuff
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this is why I need the app though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	because it's really hard to get anything but doos
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ah yea thats true
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	gotta really smack them keys
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the velocity controls are nice
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i bought an ipad air 2 for 150 bucks on marketplace this week
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	pretty much purely for piano
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	idk how good/bad that is
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm wary of old one-piece hardware since buying an S5 at the end of retail life and it's a piece of shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	2014 vintage, but it's an ios device so it still runs great
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea android devices seem to age like shite
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	a 150 dollar brand new android tablet would be worthless
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Samsung galaxy tab 4 still going strong
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	2012 iirc
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Ah no 2014
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i got a note 10.1 from 2012 which barely runs at all
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	basically just keep it for the kids
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it runs the hungry caterpiller
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I swear I can't tell the difference between these 4 piano voices
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its quite subtle
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	bit more obvious with headphones
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	good headphones haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im not a big fan of the epiano sounds either
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	er, well, i like the normal piano sounds
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	epiano was what I got rid of
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	if I could play well, I'm sure they'd sound fine
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but I can't, so at least the proper piano sounds good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its just not a very iconic epiano sound haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess its based on some old roland kit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just realised i don't have a lightning cable to charge this ipad
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	eww proprietary
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the scat on the bottom end is just BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea lightning cables are fucking garbage
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sounds a bit like a lion growl
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i was giggling at myself the other night playing some facsmilie of the shire theme in scat mode
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	nice!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	do you know the names of keys
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	dave, harry, lisa
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	nah yeah I do
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I get music notation ok, but I kinda have to translate it every time, I'm not practiced at reading it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	play the sharps from F# to D# and back again and its almost the shire
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ha so it is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	doo doo doo ba DOW ba doo doo doo
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	gas lift mechanisms are fairly standardised right
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like as long as i get one that fits it should be a swap in replacement?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually maybe ill just buy a new chair
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't get the bliss of sitting on this like i used to
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also finally got around to buying backblaze
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	gonna take so long to do the initial backup
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	WAT
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Smh you guys have cool pianos and I have this secondhand one with a sticky middle E key
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	join us
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we can form roland voltron
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but I have a yamaha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	with a sticky middle e
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	unlike our superior non-sticky keys
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that's all the reason you need to also buy an FP10
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Got the CVP 25 from 1993
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It‚Äôs as old as me
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I can‚Äôt justify another piano when this one lasted 28 years and only has one sticky key
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	same
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	sticky key should be an easy fix anyway right
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yeah I‚Äôm just lazy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Holy shit they‚Äôre still selling for this much and mr han got mine for like under $400
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i kinda figured that from the whole car thing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	my rocks be tumbling at about 55bpm so I just adjust my playing speed to line up with the rocks
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	since they‚Äôre tumbling right near piano
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	party rock is in the house....tonight?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	hello yes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	wow yours fancy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	older maybe, but fancy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It has a great feel
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ya mum
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	"your device isn't compatible with this version"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	motherfuckers
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it's just a computer
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	wtf is up with nothing having backwards compatibility anymore
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Much less people using older devices than in the past
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	People upgrade a lot faster
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Supporting older android in particular is a nightmare
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Since there's 18 billion different devices that all have their own quirks
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Be cool if they'd leave the old version there for us though, like everyone does for PC stuff. I know it was available in late 2019 from forum posts.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I guess I'll try bluestacks first, then if that doesn't work or is inconvenient I'll see if I can hunt down an old APK
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That is a thing you can do
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Up to the dev though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Assuming the app doesn't need some sort of authentication where you wouldn't want a security gap
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Mm we shall see. Another day when it's not the middle of the night
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have discovered my cat prefers to sleep on white things
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	from seeing it sleep on them, or not being able to see evidence of its passing on black things?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i thought it was a texture thing at first
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	she preferred to sleep on a hard shelf than a pet bed
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but then i put a white blanket on the bed and she slept on it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that was one data point
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have two duvets of the same material but one is dark grey and the other is white. when i have the white one on my bed she sleeps on my bed during the day
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	when it's the grey one she does not
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's definitely a temperature element to it, she won't sleep on the white tiles but she'll sleep on the carpet or perched weirdly on the door dog
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which i'd assume was a texture thing but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	she happily sleeps on a lack
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	interesting
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	please continue keeping data for science
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	She know I'm talkin bout her
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	On the door dog
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ooh!
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	have you ever kicked or stood/sat on her when she was on something dark-coloured because you couldn't see her?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Door dog
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	complete with the indentation from her laying on it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and yea she was kicked in the hallway in the dark by one of my mates when she was a kitten
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	maybe she wants to make sure she's seen
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but she has no problem getting in the way in the dark still
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	well obviously everyone can see in the dark
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	what kind of loser creature can't see in low light?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i dunno
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i am no cat psychologist but it seems unlikely she's aware she's as black as the night but that that doesn't apply in the dark

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	of COURSE bluestacks doesn't do bluetooth
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	because that'd actually be fucking useful
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	what a waste of fucking time
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this whole fucking thing

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	bunguette
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Watch for sound effects
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	am I listening for anything other than the music?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	got an older version of the piano app that supports my android version
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it runs, great
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it can see and connect to the piano, great
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fails some data exchange thing it needs to do and thus can't do anything at all
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The bendy part right at the zoom in
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Perfectly timed w guitar

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this would go great with a fedora and a disdain for women
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	would you settle for a boater and a seething hatred for all genders?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	a discerning gentlesir such as i does not settle
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	even if I call you Petal?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://i.imgur.com/QtIqxMv.mp4
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	what a strange way to carry a cat
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	doesn't he know you're meant to **squish that cat**
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its actually big brain
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because the cat can't do shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if you pick it up normally it can fuck you right up
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that one doesn't look super angry but its a good way to move ferals
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	seems like if it wanted to, it could probs escape that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and then fuck you right up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	maybe not in that order
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nah it can't move it's front legs and as long as you keep moving it won't kick it's back legs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	once you let go you gotta step back quick though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the real problem is usually grabbing it in the first place, ive used the blanket net tactic before
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	once you throw the blanket over it it usually freezes for a couple seconds then you can push it to the ground and it can't fight back
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	so you're saying... **squish that cat**
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if you push down between the shoulder blades it can't get up
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then you can grab it like above
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Nah you earn their love and trust then you just grab em

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	@Jugsy yesss ****
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	@HotelAlphaNectar wouldn't bother with colony
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It has some good bits
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But it's very Cancelled ending
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Rip
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And the mysteries being revealed aren't handled very interestingly
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Bad writing ?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It‚Äôs coming
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	In the second season they start to heavily insinuate that the RAPs (aliens) aren't just evil overlords
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And then the big reveal is that they are using human labour to build a defence network to defend them and humanity against their interstellar enemies
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Which was a cool twist
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But then the enemies attack before the defence grid is done
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And the third season ends during the attack but it's not clear if the RAPs can win or not
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I dunno it's the classic sci fi/fantasy thing of the core being really interesting but the more fantastic elements they start to reveal the more convoluted and uninteresting it gets
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Awwwww no
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I got interested as you typed that
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	And then it died
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Like blue goo in expanse

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I watched it FOR the blue goo
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I hate the blue goo
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It turned out to be nothing and I was like why did I want to know so badly I was misled
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Ruins a perfectly good sci fi political action drama
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I was taunted by a scientific mystery

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I guess because that never sets a baseline
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's hokey from the get go
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yeah the premise of serious interest didn‚Äôt really set hard
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Like u can just absorb the story
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	without a thing being The thing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	And then be ruined later

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	No that would ignite the entire site
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Startling children with a nearly-gunshot sound is always fun
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Is that too unsafe now haha

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Some bloke here at a kiosk trying to flog towmhouses for sale here
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Small backyard would actually be a bonus as it means less heavy metal contamination on your property üò¨
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I looked into those while I was working and like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea nah lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So expensive
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Big money employers in the area but still they want a lot for something that far out of town
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Have they started building the shops yet?
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Not that I could see
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Classic
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It was actually really inconvenient
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Closest shop is an IGA or something like 15 mins walk
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Not even a servo
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Flinders has this no vending machines policy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	For health reasons???
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So to get anything but water you had to walk to the Tafe building
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I guess in Flinders defence I did get more exercise as a result
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	This pisses me off so bad
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôm forced to spend money in an overpriced cafe full of wanky med students
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Ok I‚Äôm not forced to
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôm too lazy for alternatives

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Damn too fast
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The funk on the mab site is pretty good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The other cafe is very expensive and not good
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Fuck I hate those wanky med students do much tho
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Funk is a cafe
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	They congregate in the bottom of the cancer clinic as if they never learned infection control and staying the fuck out of a place full of immunocompromsied people
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	my boss goes down there and tells them to fuck off if they aren‚Äôt getting cancer treatment
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Mercifully the mab is all tech and engineers so it's just nerds and tradies from tafe
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Entitled fucks these couches aren‚Äôt for you
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Much prefer the nerds
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	something about young doctors is just the absolute fuckjngn worst
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	can barely talk to my junior doctor friend anymore it‚Äôs all ‚Äúmy mortgage‚Äù this and ‚Äúcatching up for drinks‚Äù that
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	buying a one million dollar house before age 30 like sorry can‚Äôt relate anymore
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but enjoy being a slave to that mortgage while complaining about working 70 hour weeks
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Wow this took a turn
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	End rant

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	@MrSchnookums annoyingly the USB a on the fp10 is non functional
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Firmware updates only
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So you have to use USB b for midi out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Which is like, fairly normal for some bizarre fucking reason
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But makes it next to useless for mobile devices
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah I knew the USB-A was non-functional
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	internet theories say it's just there because it shares the same parts as the FP30
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	can you not USBb>USBa>[phoneplug]?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Sure but who the fuck got USB a female to female
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I have one coming in the mail
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	coincidentally
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sorry, no, wrong
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's just extension, M>F
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I know things are a lot better with USB but man is it still annoying
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	My USB b cables are never long enough
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Also dunno why they couldn't just slap midi din ports on it but oh well
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	same reason they locked half its functionality behind stupid mobile software I guess
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Well that I get, a lot of Digital pianos have very clunky modifier commands
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And realistically most people are gonna have compatible phones haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they've already put half the commands on the keys, why not all the other shit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	doubling of voices seems like something that's pretty important
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	They put all the basic commands that you use a lot on the keys
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	There's a lot not silkscreened too https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/FP-10_Reference_eng01_W.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjZgd3J-dHvAhWH63MBHboOCb0QFjADegQIDRAC&usg=AOvVaw3NlqCLCqhLB16CvP8rzfD8
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	THIS is what I was looking for in the manual!
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but it only had things that were already obvious, ffs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Oh I missed it velocity control is on there
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The manual  does say 'go get the reference manual online' but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea I dunno they do this with all their stuff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I guess because firmware can change the behaviour of stuff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But honestly by the time I remember what keys control velocity I could have opened the app and done a bunch of stuff haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	cool now I can get DAAAOW without smashing the fuck out of it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fixed velocity is super weird
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's great when you fucken suck and can't record a lead solo without making it sound awful
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	For edm
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I bought a piano book and this feels like year 8 all over again
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Probably been highschool since I did a workbook
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's humbling though because I thought I remembered how to read music and then made some rookie mistakes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It told me to draw treble clefs on the other page and I'm like nahhhhhh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Literally never been useful in my life
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	draw them esses instead
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Hahaha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Why is F labeled as 3rd finger in exercise 6 when D is labeled 2nd
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Evidently I did need practice
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Case in point
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	F is always ring finger right hand in C
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha you're showing great improvement graf, keep at it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Although I didn't learn piano fingering until now
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	ohhh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I forgive u
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Thanks for checking my work
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	lmao any time
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Keep up the good work son
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Fuck I‚Äôm still laughing at this
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That S
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	nostalgia
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The cool s
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The only S
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Rate my bass clefs
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	At first they bummed me out but it ended with a cat so can‚Äôt really criticise
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Also what helps with fingering (this sounds really dumb but works) is just write the number of the finger in sharpie on your fingernail
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	my teacher did this for us when was a kid and in my mind I can still see my fingers numbered when playing and helps you look at notation with fingers and instantly spatially map how to play it as you get more advanced
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That way it‚Äôs less reading music and more reading location and position on they keyboard and then confirming with ear
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	if u always know middle finger is 3 then seeing 3 somewhere instantly localises in ur mind on they key map where your thumb and pinky go and you can get faster
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I prefer a specific publication for music bc they have flawless finger numbering on really complex pieces and it makes it so much faster to learn
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Hmm
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I hate writing shit on my hands
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I'll just wear some surgical gloves
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Fingernails bruh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	They aren‚Äôt part of ur hands

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Wife had first day at SA Health today. She hasn't come home yet for full debrief but apparently there is a lot of mansplaining involved with the role
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	She thinks it might be a bit below her skill level, but at least it's a foot in the door
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Time to show them mansplainers how an overskilled woman does it.
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Hah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Why is it 9pm
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Who thought that was a good idea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I stayed back and chatted to a coworker for a bit and now I got home at 9 and I have to go to bed
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	No electrification is worth this
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Are you being electrified at work? Do you need someone external to dob them in for physical abuse?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	No my train line is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And as per fucking usual they can't do it right so it's been delayed
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Unrelated news I'm looking at cheap apartments on realestate and they give me this little pop up like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Considered buying?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Fucker I wouldn't be looking for sub 300 dollar rentals if I could afford to buy it
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Considered taking on a crushing amount of debt?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Anyone here lived in a studio
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I think I'd be ok with it but storage space worries me
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Ages a go
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yah you'll need a one/two bedder with the amount of hobby stuff U got
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Unless you find a studio with a lockup
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea you're probably right
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Without it being as inconvenient as it is now at least
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Using the dining table haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	There's a decent amount of two bedroom places in my price range which makes me ü§î
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But they tend to be a bit naff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	At the very least I need a bathroom that doesn't make me go oof when I look at it

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's like

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That kind of thing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I'll deal but I also hate shower curtains

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Bathrooms that make you go oof
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Didn't look good in the 50s either
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I've used a shower that actually had a wooden floor. Like slotted decking.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Was weird, but not awful. Wouldn't like to own it though.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You get those in beach houses a lot for some reason
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	They're not too bad
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But like just normal timber flooring in a bathroom is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Nahhhh
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	This was indeed a beach house. Sadly not up for rent anymore.

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i assume they had an argument lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	why do i love this so much
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Something like that. Naturally one participant took their bat and ball and went home, as well as throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Sssh don't teach beavers how to boat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is a no üö´ drama zone we're just here to talk about hobbies and look at pictures of things
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Can I also talk about pictures of things?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I guess one might consider that a hobby
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So if we can talk about hobbies, we can talk about talking about pictures of things

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I was gonna take a more expanded discord break but nah, still done with radelaide though. Anyway, hobbies? Hobbies.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hobbies
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Here's a DIY analogue dripper cos bought ones are dumb and bad and dumb
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	The Tiger eye is necessary to align the water's chakras
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	adds negative ions to the water as it runs across, making the plants happier
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Which coincidentally cures covid
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i didn't do bujo last month and it's been my worst month mentally in a very long time, not sure if cause or effect though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all i can say is cadbury chocolate eggs didn't help
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but they definitely didn't hurt
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	There's a crappy feeling coming back to neglected bujo
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Seeing your previous momentum
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea im banking on the feeling of getting back to having a handle on things will override that haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i also only meditated once :think:
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Disgraceful
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Looks like another full day of Valheim
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i played that for one evening
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i will probably play evil genius 2 today
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	went for a small ride and did gym, now at a family barbie
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah I saw half my friends list on evil genius 2, never played OG
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	fyeah bud nailing it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	original was amazing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is a pretty good remake
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its not a very good sequel, they barely did anything
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and some of the stuff they did do makes it worse haha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I suspected nostalgia hype
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Its so nice to be able to shrug off steam sales and hype games now Ive found something I can really sink in to
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they replaced a really simple and elegant "move your minions as pieces on a board" world map system
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	with this bizarrely hard to read and understand lowpoly world map
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the lair gameplay is generally improved but the world map stuff is worse
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	bit of a shame
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i also miss the british woman base computer
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it was so ridiculously bond/powers

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	interesting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the basic idea of evil genius is you do shit on world map to make money/progress domination plan, which generates heat with the NATOs of the world who send their agents to your lair to gather intel (which raises heat more), sabotage stuff, steal your shit, assassinate the genius, etc. you stop them with a combination of traps (rube-goldberg traps is the intent, you can push agents around and stuff) and minions (who can just beat the shit out of people or shoot them)
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the ideal way to deal with an agent is to bamboozle them enough until they go home
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can do that by lowering their stats with traps and distractions, and you have a casino cover operation that can help a lot with that
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	dope
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	my genius mostly sits in his tiny office yelling on the pa
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I think we already talked about Valheim not grabbing you, but we have a dedi if you wanna play more at any point, poss get a gear boost out of our handmedowns lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i enjoyed it but don't have much interest in playing MP
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i enjoy exploring survival games from the ground up with mates but when there's a disparity in progress/understanding i find it usually gets boring quickly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	going through the motions instead of learning by doing
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Yeah a couple of us got on weeks before the rest and kinda had to stfu and leave em to it to not kill it haha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	we're almost all at the same level now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wish i could wipe my brain and play minecraft SMP for the first time again
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	fuckin right
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	esp with how much more is going on now than first time I started (alpha lol)
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	*but* would you wipe development back to early days too? Lose inv on server logout etc?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	no chests
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	stop it you're hurting me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that's what bukkit was for
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	we had a big warehouse room where we'd place all blocks before disconnecting
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	was bukkit around that early?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	maybe not bukkit but there was an SMP server plugin that did inventory storage
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i played SP minecraft for one night and then got up in the after noon (played all night ofc) and went and found an SMP server that was not even started yet on the forums and
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well still talk to some of those guys
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	signs were client-side
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but chests worked iirc
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh yea the signs didn't actually display text either you had to interact with them and get a popup
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	those were simpler times
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i built a really cool city and ended up befriending the admin and becoming an admin, but then one of his IRL friends blew up my city with admin dynamite right before a world backup
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	was full on depressed about it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	classic pub servers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	eventually was in a skype call with the guy and i abused him monologue for like 10 minutes and eventually drove a wedge in their relationship by constantly talking shit about him hahaha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	don't regret it he was a dickhead in general
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh yea and no player/mob damage but creepers still destroyed blocks
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I never played with randoms. I was always host. We had a nice server going. Occasional bit of light trolling (remember falling through the world before the bottom layer became bedrock?) but nothing too bad
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so the server script had to have anti-creeper supression
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea this was the only pub server i ever played on and after the destruction of the town of nakano (and once i got over it and came back) we ended up having block protection so griefing was basically not a thing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we had a nation system and new users could either fuck about in the non-claimed areas of the map or sign up to a nation and help build city
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	man there are so many people i liked there that are lost to time
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	so it goes

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I have this significant brain glitch, with travelators, if I don't look at them directly I see them running in the opposite direction
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I keep almost running in to people as I try and go up to Woolies
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	And I just scared the shit out of this poor woman by yelling "WATCH YOUR STEP!" as she went to step on the correct one. I was legit expecting to see her face plant and she just travelated up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	They look awesome. Wonder what the triangle one is. I don't know enough to name any but the 747.

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	is it a step through frame or not
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Either or
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Says two different types so assume the girl is on the step trhough and the bloke is on the more rigid frame possible for mountain biking, although not with those tyres
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	do people actually mountain bike with ebikes?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	seems like a lot of extra weight
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	yes very common
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Get more runs up
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	The amount of money you see at a park is astronomical
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	but yeah dont think it's for me with the extra weight and most places have a climb able path even for the semi unfit
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Was keen to get an add on battery that could be swapped around bikes but think I'll just spend that $1k on a better dual suspension

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	he talks about city planning a lot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	with a focus on bicycles
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hes one of those things you watch knowing you will agree 100% with all his points for me lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the classic "cars ruin literally everything about cities"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but he's not whiny about it very matter of fact
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	he did a good video on how copenhagen fucking sucks for riding bikes compared to the netherlands
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that it's the perfect model for western cities to copy, because it doesn't make major changes to road infrastructure
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and it's still a lot better than most north american cities
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	They scrapped our east-west bikeway
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i watch people riding down main north road and think fucking hell you gotta have a deathwish

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and i sit there in a traffic jam
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thinking
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what was the fucking point
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	of building this fucking motorway
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if it's just going to get backed up

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	That's decent, most entry level locally ($1500 ish) you don't get suspension or proper display or anything
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	yeah very cheap for an ebike but dont reckon it would be as good quality as their normal MTB offerings

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	linked him yesterday but this series talks about why american cities (and thus also ours) suck balls https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_SXXTBypIg&list=PLJp5q-R0lZ0_FCUbeVWK6OGLN69ehUTVa
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	from a general society standpoint but we are selfish and dont give a fuck about others
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not just on a societal level, there's plenty of people that hate living in suburbs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because they're so fucking inconvenient
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	many would hate living in the city or high density
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and the modern suburb doesn't even have the benefits that suburbs were meant to provide; space for everyone to "live"
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	why?
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	mcmansions are bigger than ever before
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since we're now packing more and more houses in the same amount of space

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all the new housing developments ive been to in the last decade are tiny little half blocks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	obviously people do build bigger houses
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but most people can't afford that
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Haven't watched yet, but high density urban is the best environmental choice hehe
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	i know so many people that go build out at munno west or aldinga because new *big house then hate it and cant get the cost back

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea munno para west is a perfect example
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	most of the houses there are tiny
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there are some bigger ones but they mostly cropped up before the big development

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i ordered some of those stretchy laces
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	keen to see if they're any good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the ones i normally get are good but they break easy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i normally get these kind
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they just stick in eye to eye, so the weak point is the thin bit that sits in the eye
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so i ordered some full elastic laces you lace up normally but are stretchy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i should have guessed this but they're noisy

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	your laces go there normally
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	do you feel the laces?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its the same depth as a round lace
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which means its about the same depth as a folded flat lace

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they're about to have a concert in the lobby
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's a fleet idol in-universe
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	during the vocaloid collab its miku
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i forgot about the other group that isn't the idol that has a stage where the characters get up and do a choreographed dance with a mini rhythm game
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and the idea that it exists in canon is hilarious to me because it means all the members of this expeditionary force fighting against the darkness of the universe also have to practice the concert dances
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but then the second song of this 2 song concert directly breaks the fourth wall by referencing the name of the game so maybe im thinking about it too hard

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	looks like they don't know how to tie their laces
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well thats just streetwear fashion
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lacing up shoes is not in vogue
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	how they stay on feet??
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i mean proper fitting shoes don't fall off unlaced unless you're running
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	at least
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	basketball/lifestyle shoes like that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	part of it is fashion part of it is when they're tied up they crease more
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since they bend instead of your heel lifting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's not practical don't get me wrong
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	maybe not literally fall all the way off, but ordinary sneakers are pretty much split in half until laced
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they remind me of these
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	sorry i meant untied

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats pretty accurate for yeezys in general yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i suppose the "normal" yeezys aren't that weird looking

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think the problem is less the material and more how to get it to stay there with the rubbing motion that causes the squeak
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	might try with electrical tape rather than sticky tape though

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	What a nice drive i flogged it here lmao checked my oil, no warning lights on, full traction control
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	had to do a dodgy overtake of a cyclist on a blind corner but it was his fault for suicidally cycling up here with no shoulder
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i wonder where the law lands on that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	at a basic level they got every right to be on the road, but if they're riding significantly slower than the speed limit than they're obstructing other vehicles
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It‚Äôs so unsafe they have no shoulder just cliff wall or cliff drop
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	like bruh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Globes acquired
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	The law says: wait
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	fuck the law wait so I can have a Porsche run up my ass and kill all of us simultaneously nah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	right but it's an offence to drive significantly slower than the speed limit (i don't think the exact amount is codified) and bikes have to follow all speed limits so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno feels like the same rule should apply
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I agree
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	If they can‚Äôt safely let cars overtake bc no shoulder, then probably don‚Äôt cycle there
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Should more be common sense
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well no
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's not their fault
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it‚Äôs the roads fault
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	safety is the drivers responsibility as well not just the cyclist
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's local government for not installing bike infrastructure
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	If I were a cyclist I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúwow this makes unsafe situations I probably won‚Äôt cycle here‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	bc it‚Äôs all blind corners and cliffs and no shoulder
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but noooooo gotta get that hills cyclist cred
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ok boomer
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Hardly a boomer take
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the real solution without having to build anything isn't that people shouldn't cycle there
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's that everyone should drive more slowly
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	ok, going 40 on a 60 road is fine but going 40 approaching a blind corner with a cyclist literally on your lip as soon as you go round the corner is still unsafe
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	You still can‚Äôt see or anticipate them
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	And they can‚Äôt swerve away from you
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Is my point
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and if you swerve away from them, hope there isn‚Äôt an oncoming car
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so make the speed limit cycle speed
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	problem solved
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Im just gonna smoke a bunch of weed about it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so about 13km uphill then
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	love it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I get to have the opinions I‚Äôm driving the road today smh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	If I could anticipate magically where a cyclist would be, that would be great. No matter the speed I will still be driving faster than them........we all know  this lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think cycling should always have priority over liquid exploding metal roller boxes
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	ok but on hills roads with no shoulder and a cliff
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	let‚Äôs not get the context here twisted
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	These are already hazardous roads
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Specifically the one to cleland
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Other hills roads fine but this one is a death trap
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	There was a bad head on here like two weeks ago

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	make the roads safer for cyclists sure
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	if they can‚Äôt cycle safely on a shared road due to bad infrastructure, boohoo, I can‚Äôt drive my car through the park on bike paths either
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	are we talking summit road or what
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the one that turns off greenhill to cleland
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	dunno the name I never know road names only visual landmarks
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	very poor sense of direction can‚Äôt read a map sry
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea thats lofty summit i think
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Fantastic road to drive on in awd with good tyres
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	If ur confident
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats a popular biking road so i'd just one way car traffic and give a lane to bikes

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I think that‚Äôs a good solution
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno if a 4km one way road actually makes sense but anyway üòÑ
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I hope ur all happy karma got me and I was stuck behind a cyclist the ENTIRE DESCENT of greenhill and I didn‚Äôt overtake him
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he was very handsome and had a great ass so it was fine
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he gave me a thumbs up at the bottom so we‚Äôre cool
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the change in... surface tension? when they complete the circuit, looks awesome
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	It's tough as a cyclist I also agree there should be banned roads for cyclists possibly or speed limits dropped even further to say 30km which is near what a road cyclist would climb at on a not too steep grade
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	But yeah I agree in general less car infrastructure more PT, bikes etc
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Timed bike lanes is the stupidest thing going
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	me: mum can we get some bike infrastructure mum: we have bike infrastructure at home bike infrastructure at home:
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Mt barker rd (the old road through the hills before the freeway) has island seperated cycling lanes and yet everytime I drive up there for the MTb park they use the car lanes to fly down the hill and cut across without warning
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i suppose dickheads are dickheads regardless of what they're driving
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Summit road also has pedestrians cross it for our major hiking track (waterfully gully)
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	absolutely and bicycles are gonna have less impact
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Hills roads are tough it is the only infrastructure for many people
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	And obviously a car is almost the only option 90% of the time
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	So yeah I'd probably agree with lower speed limits
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Even tho I'm often the dickhead racing down them

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	That sharp taste that's in sparkling water
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	What actually causes that? And why, since lunchtime, can I taste it in every water I drink (multiple sources and vessels and yes I even tried a little moustache rinse first)?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Am dying?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The taste of carbonic acid
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Ur taste receptors individually sensing that
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But this part I‚Äôm not sure
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Maybe you‚Äôve already been dead for a week and now you‚Äôre tasting it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I sure do hope carbonic acid hypersensitivity is a guaranteed indicator of a simple dietary insufficiency that also happens to cause some ADHD like symptoms
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Is that weird?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	weird is in the eye of the beholder
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its not called sodastream unless its from the sodastream region of france, otherwise its just called sparkling water

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	This message sponsored by the government of south australia
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Lol wow
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess they have those local ads hooked in
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like spofty podcasts have
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and i dunno i have barely played america
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Is there something where ads are injected based on your location? Many streaming services do
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Oh yep that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all the trucks are longer
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which makes it a bit harder
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but most of the spaces are wider because murica so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	main gameplay difference is the front of the truck is about 10 nautical miles from where you sit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think i prefer ATS simply because i know more about america and i recognise a lot more
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also BIG TRUCK
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	instead of piddly euro truckette

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I hear people talking about "18 wheelers" like that meant to be big
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they use the same kind of tractors
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we just tend to have longer trucks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we have an interesting mix of cab overs and american cabs

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is what high expectations looks like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the white markers are where they want the trailer

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think i tried eurotrucks once and man was i bad at reversing, even with overhead view
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Pray i never have to tow a trailer
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you get used to it but its still hard

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Laces were invented to be an unnecessary obstacle to freeing one's feet of the oppression of shoes

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all tastes the same when you slather it with marg and nutella
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	absolutely makes a difference for sangas
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	only benefit for toast IMO is more filling usually but i don't eat toast to get full
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it is a taste delivery platform
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ew Nutella on bread

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Why do you need to add Marg to Nutella
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	That's the weird part
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i like the taste of melted marg on toast
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	in fact i will eat just toast + marg
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	What‚Äôs wrong with butter
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	You animal
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Toast and Marg yeah for sure
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nothing i just don't see a reason to get butter over marg
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The taste?!?!!
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	It is a lot better
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	But there's middle ground products now you don't have to choose
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't think marg is significantly worse than butter
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	It's not 1994
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah marg is ok but butter is awesome
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/butter-vs-margarine
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The taste is all I care about
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	spreadable butter is still kind of pricey and im not convinced it's not just marg
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Butter is godly
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Browned butter in a pan + anything you‚Äôre cooking
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Incredible
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	just take your butter out for like 10 mins before spreading it mang
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have never thought about having toast more than 30 seconds before bread was in the toaster
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I just use it off the block
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Thin enough slices and it melts fast anyway
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Yeah it's knife technique, I hate when the whole block is soft, so gross
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	stick butter is inconvenient so i basically never use that outside of cooking
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	damn that‚Äôs the only butter we have
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but also i don't care marg is fine lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	For some reason every time I buy spreadable butter i forget it exists or leave it at work or something
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i aint buying homebrand marg fwiw it usually tastes like plastic
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but one level up and its good
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Marg isn't my problem in this equation anyway
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nutella on toast is like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	staple
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Crap bread and wasting nutella on toast is my disappointment
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Nutella is weird in that is marketed as a bread spread, but that's the one thing it sucks for
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	thick seedy bread, toasted, with a layer of butter and brown sugar
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That‚Äôs my jam
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	*jam*
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it‚Äôs not quite jam
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its delicious on bread what are you on about
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but it is my jam
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Nutella on crackers is the way
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Like unsalted plain
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Spoon Finger Icecream In cooking
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	All good
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Bread bad
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	It's good if the bread is ridic fresh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	look i am sorry you can't enjoy the finer things in life like nutella on homebrand bread
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Fresh bread is like crack in its own right
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	If the bread is heaps fresh, putting anything but butter, maybe a little honey at most, on it is a waste
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Schnook is now invited to my bread party
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	PLEASE

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Consensus says it's great
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Horsie continues to refuse to leave the corner above the fridge
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So today I moved a couple plants over there to hopefully give him some of those stupid flying bugs to eat

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	he was only a logistics officer so once he spilled the beans on what he knew the rebels were like cool you're useless now go join the corps
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and now he's booting around with the other random agents and soldiers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i always think the rebels are portrayed as too nice

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	he's been so good, chilling on the kitchen ceiling for a week
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	spooders are persona non grata in this household
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm mostly afraid of them but he's only a baby, and real cripply
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	little fucker kept trying to dive into my spaghetti sauce when I was cooking tonight
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	so I sprayed him with water, like one would a cat on a counter
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i murdered a daddy long legs in the shower today
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	which made him go back to the ceiling for like 30 seconds, before descending again
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	he figured he was gonna chill in the corner above the shower
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this was not to be
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	man just wanted to go for a swim smdh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	in both cases
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they do be like this
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	if only we could communicate
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im paranoid of the fan cover in the shower
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fair
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they're bad news
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	one time when i was a kid it fell on me while i was in the shower and like 3 spiders were on me fuck that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	above-shower spiders seem to be notorious for dropping on folks
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that is traumatising
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i assume the moisture fucks with their grip
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	reckon?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or they pass out from the heat
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sometimes it seems deliberate
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	you'd think they'd walk away before it got that bad
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably deliberate spiders are bad
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	for the record, horsie was over steam too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but he definitely wasn't having trouble sticking
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the abseiling was clearly deliberate
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	on a web string though right?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yep
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	as opposed to just crawling on the ceiling
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i won't pretend to know what the mechanism is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and im not going to look it up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I *did* look up huntsmans on strings after I saw him do it last weekend
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	couldn't find other references to it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	my phobias are spooders and heights which makes minecraft a bit dicey sometimes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and I've never seen another huntsman do it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	MC spids are pretty toony though, right?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i was building a sauron/imperial city tower one time in minecraft and i climbed to the top of the tower to work on it and there was a spider up there and i nearly had a heart attack
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fell off and died
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	literally just sat there on the adrenaline
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	brilliant

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	kinda spoopy in the caves too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's anything for me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think i don't like tight spaces either but never really tried
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah same no thanks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i used to have nightmares of getting stuck in maintenance tunnels of some sort
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yuck
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	them folks who go caving and shimmy through crevices only as wide as themselves
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im also afraid of commitment
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no...
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha yeah I can relate to that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	never mind no im not
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually....
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I've decided I'm indecisive
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	are you sure
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	weeeelll...

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i can't say im cut up about it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	he's only got one back leg!
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it takes away some of the spideriness of the movement
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not having so many legs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	eugh i was imagining how he escaped the brood and then i started imagining hundreds of little spiders yuck yuck
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	idk I haven't seen others around
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm guessing it got damaged by someone in my ceiling
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	your son
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	now THAT'S a scary thought
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you only feed him once a week he has to make up the rest hunting
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	gonna put "having children" at the top of my list of fears
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	anyway after planting thoughts of spiders in your head, it's time for me to go to bed
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its ok i will cover them with the horrors of c# programming

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	honestly i wouldn't have cared so much for the row if there wasn't kids involved
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	obviously i don't want them to fight but it's a lot more important to the family with kids
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i apologise post and in advance for any related talk none of you obviously care about haha but i will probably vent a bit more
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this is fine and understandable
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	hope they sort their shit out

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	mum and i convinced him to since staying there wasn't going to help
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they both seem ready to burn it so hopefully some time away will allow cooler heads to prevail
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but he went to pick up some clothes and the gate was locked and he hasn't come back yet so :ablobshrug:

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	better question: how to make the underside of my table more convenient for storing flat things?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	would probably require some level of lying down under there to access
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	actually depending on size, under the printer table would probably be much easier, since it has a gap between the top and the frame
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	*cooool story*
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Horsie lives!

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	lol our town was originally just a train station and a uni
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	‚ÄúCollege station‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	So it just ended up totally bisected by the rail line as the town grew
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they built the station and then they had to build a uni to teach people why the fuck they built a station there
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Agricultural and mechanical uni
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Basically for maintaining trains and farm machines to put grain and ag stuff on trains
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and yea so many US towns, particularly in the "west" (of the Appalachians) have a railway smack bang in the middle
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	*the circle of trains*
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since thats the only reason they exist lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yep hahaha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Was fun tho counting the trains
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Sometimes 100 cars
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	And like three engines
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Went on for a mile
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Crazy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea 3 engines is standard for mainline trains
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	interestingly, to me anyway, UP was the last to adopt that
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	So many engines
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they tried to just have big fuckoff locomotives instead of having 3 normal ones
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Omg theres two kids like age 5 just screaming and going wild bc the train pulled up
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	THE TRAIN IS HERE LOOK DAD I SEE THE TRAIN
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so they had gas turbine ones that would literally melt overpasses with the exhaust if it idled under there

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Not at all lol, I‚Äôve learned the trick is just let it dry the fuck out while still misting the top half, before watering again
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	So the roots still get air once in a while
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and it seems to be ok with that

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	definitely paint strokes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	whether intentionally textured or just shit at painting, who knows
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I accidentally almost ran out of return time on some clothes I hate
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oops
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	hopefully they don't bull a bitch move and say it's more than 30 days by the time the parcel gets to them
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	times like these it's annoying not having a printer
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	a 2D one
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh yeah I was gonna buy that microscope

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	aaaaand that's gonna be home time
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	A bird shat on me today at lunch
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	a little green parrot
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Did you eat it in retribution?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	The bird, that is, not the shit
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Too smal, not enough meat on it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	hahaha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Quail already too small
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I ate seven quails once and was still hungry hey
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	also felt bad about that later
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Seems like the sort of thing you have one of with a bunch of other stuff, not a whole feed
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I had a quail drumstick once. I already have no patience for the fiddliness of chook drumsticks. It truly was a waste of my time. I don't even recall it being that good
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Thrice-roasted duck though...
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it was a Greek wedding and they had a buffet with this tray of like 100 little roasted quails
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I was like ‚Äúhow many whole birds can I eat‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	probably could have done 10-12
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Haha yeah ok i can see how it went that way
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	But imagine
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	How many small green parrots you could eat
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Four I bet
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	TIL you can get fuzzy logics for way cheaper than i thought https://www.amazon.com.au/Panasonic-Rice-Cooker-White-SR-CN108WST/dp/B07SBY4DY6/
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	feel like last i looked it was import from japan or get a dumb cooker
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh doesn't look like induction though so i guess thats why its a lot cheaper
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Found my old tape measure!
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	now THIS is reality TV I could get in to
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	especially if they put the usual reality tv suspects on it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Ok I‚Äôm gonna take the rocks out now
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Theyve been in stage two for like
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	10 days now

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I fell asleep and did laundry
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But not in that order
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Fixed
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ha i thought it was at first glance
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I thought this was someone tumbling rocks at first glance
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	delicious
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it‚Äôs not even a bad idea if you buy flat gummies and wait yeah no it‚Äôs a bad idea
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	my washing machine has stopped beeping when it‚Äôs done
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Thank fuck
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	How am I SUPPOSED TO Know, the tumbler makes the same tumble sound as the washer from across the house
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so I just ignore the laundry
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	bc I never hear the beep
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Why has god forsaken me
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I paid for a stupid machine learning washing machine with features I don‚Äôt want and it turns off it‚Äôs only useful feature
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôm mad
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you need a smart washer so you get a notification and also it sells your data to china
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	my valuable laundry data
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	tracking how many graphic tees you own and sending you ads for dating sites
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	‚ÄúThis filthy piece of shit used the *highly soiled* setting how disgusting‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	You know weirdly I never get dating site ads maybe they know I‚Äôve sunk too much shared furniture into this relationship to ever end it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hahaha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Samsung?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	this is dark
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i get them a lot but i guess the data doesn't reflect that my heart is as cold as the space between worlds
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It made graf laugh which is what I was going for huehue
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Nah it‚Äôs a cheap budget knockoff one
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	‚ÄúEsatto‚Äù lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats weird
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have literally no memory of typing hahaha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	that‚Äôs because a true laugh isn‚Äôt planned
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Got u
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Idk what to do about being such a sad sack and the effect it has on gf. She's really cool and supportive most of the time but any argument she's like you're cold and distant, you used to be happy etc etc. Idk if it's better if I just get out of her life lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Sorry heavy I know I just don't have anyone else to vent at rn
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably worth talking to a therapist if you're not already, they won't solve the problem but should help you look more objectively at stuff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and talk about it openly with your partner, obviously at the end of the day its something you will need to deal with yourself but having her in support rather than at odds with it will be better
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's not your responsibility to decide what's best for her
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Yeah goin weekly at the moment. I'm trying to be as open as possible but it's difficult in between all the other 'normal' stresses and issues of life
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i won't pretend to have any further helpful advice but feel free to vent
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if life ever gets you down just remember at least you're not my student who asked me how to copy something in windows
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	When mr han gets down for a while sometimes, I aggressively push spending time somewhere outside the house together, force us to go on walks and drives and give him less space alone if that makes sense, I try to make my presence felt when he‚Äôs like alone playing guitar or working out, I‚Äôll just stand around and hang out and talk shit and ask questions, encourage him to ramble for 20 mins about technical things I don‚Äôt understand, and it always helps him centre himself and feel more in control and grounded in reality and not sad mental anxiety spirals. what I‚Äôm trying to say is, forced quality time actually works (for us) to get your brain out of the ‚Äúthinking about myself and my struggles‚Äù rut, I think extra presence of a persons support kinda nudges the ol mental health engine a bit. Perhaps just say all this to her, and your fears, and ask for extra attention - it‚Äôs not selfish, it‚Äôs just the nurturing give and take nature of relationships.  Also this could be wildly off base because I don‚Äôt know anything about your relationship dynamics, sorry. @Jugsy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Also, you have nothing to lose by this, consider quitting alcohol for a month or so even if you only drink casually. The effect of its total absence on ur mental health is remarkable
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Plus, you‚Äôre forced to not be okay with being bored and buzzed, you gotta make your own fun (frustrating at first but rewarding long term)
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	And there‚Äôs no shame in saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm too sad and it‚Äôs affecting you in ways that you might not be comfortable telling me - please know that I think about this a lot and I don‚Äôt want to burn you out. Can you help me think of some new stuff to do together that we‚Äôd enjoy?‚Äù Because I‚Äôve been there and it‚Äôs definitely scary to hear the person you love think that they‚Äôre so sad that they‚Äôre unlovable or unwanted, but she‚Äôs making the choice every day to be there to support you, go ahead and lean on her but use your voice to give her the means to begin helping you in ways she might not know to yet.
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Thanks heaps
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Now for something lighter
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	https://www.retrojunk.com/article/show/417/the-death-of-garfield
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But also keep venting this is just in case U don‚Äôt wanna
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I have zero helpful advice, but i hope it gets better for you both
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wtf these mfers stole my dog
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Virtual dog I hope
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea in kingdom
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I get mixed up with names. Is that the linear base-buildy one?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its not really a base builder but yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's side scroller
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you do expand the town(s) but its uhh
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	What counts as base building really
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I played that one
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno really how to explain it its nothing like any other game ive played
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	You build a base
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I enjoyed until it got too hard and it doesn't let you save
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what it reminds me the most of is majesty but it's totally different to majesty
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Big ol "fuck you, your enjoyment is wrong if you don't want to spend another 3 hours getting to the same point again" thanks devs fuck you too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Difficulty setting wouldn't go astray either
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the game is totally different to that now haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Really? Last time i played was around the time they released the MP version
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	The art style was beautiful
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	was there a boat?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	in the new version but i don't think in the one i was playing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea in the original version it was just one map and the challenge was to complete that map
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	then in new lands they added going to different islands
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	in the newest version you can go back to previous islands and your town is still there
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and when you die you just become the heir i think in the most built up island
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah I've seen others playing NL, but i haven't played it. Wouldn't have gotten that far anyway
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you move pretty quick
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	in two crowns you have to since the upgrades are gated until you unlock a structure on the next island
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but then you can return to the other islands to spend gems you didn't have before
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and, well, defeat the greed since you can't do that until you unlock the bomb
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	**BOMBS**
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Actually the one I played had mounts. Not sure if that is original or not
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Like uhh not just original horsie
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the og had a black horse too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	new lands added the unicorn and shit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Mm maybe my playing memories are mixed with my watching memories
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Either way, I gave up
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the shogun version is cute
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hella tanuki running around
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	getting shot
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	That one had racoons or something like that as small game, right?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	tanuki yea
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Oh that's what you were talking about
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Never heard of them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they are racoon dogs which is different to raccoons
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	more like foxes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think they're only called raccoon dogs because they're foxes with raccoon faces
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	My quick search got as far as confirming "canine"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Damn Forcepoint looking over my shoulder
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im a fucken samurai with a griffin
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i miss my dog
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Rip
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe dog will thrive with the greed and end up a big boss
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	That would be fun
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Marinate the meat
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	That looks like a blender bucket. Blent meat üòñ
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	(I know some things call for processed meat but in that form it looks wrong)
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It sure is hahaha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and I grabbed it bc it was recently washed and close
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	probably should use a bowl
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But everything‚Äôs a Bowl if it holds liquid
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I might actually have now flavoured my smoothie blending cup teriyaki oh no
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it‚Äôs gonna have that smell
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Why did I do this
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think you'll find that's a drum
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	The teriyaki smell will wash out she'll be right
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	man I‚Äôm good at quick executive action but not great at planning those actions
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Grabbing life by the bougainvillea with both hands
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	You made my palms tingle haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Monstera would never hurt you though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Unless you eat it raw maybe. Is it one of those guys full of calcium oxalate?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I know the fruit is fine
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Itchy too much latex in the leaves and stem

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I'm watching a movie where Jared Leto joins the Yakuza
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Should be high quality
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	This movie is really fucken odd
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	go on
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Jared Leto is a creepy looking dude and he's a creepy dude in this movie
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's shot weird
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The pacing is wack
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Most of the acting is awful
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I see
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I ended up stopping it and watching that new shadow and bone series
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Peets 'n beans
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	We're trying this too atm. I'm interested in the world they've got goin on but some of the exposition and acting has been cringe af, hoping that settles down
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	And they're gonna have to do a lot more with the main character than literally ||the sun shines out her arse|| for me to stay interested
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Haha yes I laughed when it kicked off with voice over exposition
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Like really this is what you're doing for your first impression
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Everything has a layer of weirdness to it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I'm only halfway through ep 2 but I'm still interesting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I just realised
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It watches like a YA novel reads
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Yeah but then it's sexy and gory too so they're going for a more adult audience maybe
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Or is the vague almost sex and kinda gore just normal YA now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Probably
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	There hasn't been anything overt in the first two eps
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea the novel it's based on is ya haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Makes a lot of sense
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	There ya go

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	then Horsie had a mad dash to the bathroom window after I opened it to the warm breeze
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	first time I've seen him get around so quickly in ages
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	doesn't seem to be trying to get out though. I don't know what his game is
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and the best one: found jumping spider in the hall
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	took a bit of convicing, but moved him to the bathroom
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	standing there watching him, going "turn around. look there's a bug behind you. look. look!"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	til eventually he turned around, saw bug, waited for it to come closer, pounced!
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	"YES! Nice- what the fuck, man?"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	immediately dropped the bug

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's so many of them on sale that it's just a sea of spines
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so they basically have to put the blurb in the title to get eyes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	surely that makes it harder to find what you want
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	keywords!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well japanese sentence structure is a lot different to english
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it does end up basically being keywords
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	most of these titles have only tangential relation to the content too

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	people hoard them, releasing them can fuck up the _natural balance_
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	heres some nests+outworlds where ants would be kept
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the idea is you only catch as many as you can look after/give to people who will look after
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	My family feel a strong connection to you now Jugsy
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	excellent

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And yes that means what it sounds like it means
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I said that and then I realised what it sounds like is not what it actually is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	What I mean is they got scientists making various crotch scent chemicals
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	All the flavours

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats the plan
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no train is ruining my life
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also it's just generally very inconvenient to live this far from town

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	those the kind of tiles that expand towards you in 3d in nightmares
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	idk about decor to live in really, esp not in a rental, but I still have opinions
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Sometimes when I‚Äôm mega baked I get this illusion that they‚Äôre pushing out and the wall is collapsing
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Portal/Qube vibes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't think i have particularly high standards but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	painted concrete bricks are a no from me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	a last option haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	given the rental market atm, caring about looks seems a difficult proposition
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i just think i'd be more miserable in a place like that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	put up pictures!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nice one
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Need some windows, trees, grass, that‚Äôs about it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	even if you use command hooks the landlords get pissy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	my standards are the outside has to be nice to hang out in
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they shouldn't have anything to say really unless it's broken when you leave
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Shit yard is a dealbreaker for me
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and white is easy to paint over if you fuck it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	We just drilled holes and filled them after huehue nobody noticed in 6 years
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they shouldn't, but they do
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	In fact the agent didn‚Äôt even know which fixtures were ours vs theirs by the end
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and asked where one went
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Hahahaha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i had blu tac pictures on painted aluminium built in doors
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and the landlord told me to take em down
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sounds like you had a cunt landlord
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	sure
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	most of em are lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	once it's up the "damage" is done
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this is true
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and you don't know if they're good until you got em
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Ours luckily have never been to this house in person haha and only seen photos
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so not risking it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they live in victoria lmao suckers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea usually been through agents doing inspections but sometimes thats worse
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Our new agent (had 3 in one year) is so good
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he‚Äôs very young
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	your agent is an alien, han
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	agents seem to be pretty much universally cunts
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	or just too lazy to do anything, which is preferable
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	young ones are alright in my experience yea
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	He‚Äôs younger than me for sure, and he was like, afraid to enter the house for inspection and asked me permission to open doors and shit
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Then he was like ‚Äúyou passed! It‚Äôs great! Bye‚Äù runs to car
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	you should contact han's agent directly and ask what rentals he has :P
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	excuse me for my sexism but it's the 30s women agents that give you the grief
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Dude yes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they got so much to prove for some reason
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it's a power trip I think
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It is
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The egos on em
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Karen you don‚Äôt own this whole neighbourhood gtfo my face about the single scuff on the skirting
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	my chick agents were arseholes, the dudes were just useless
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like, book an inspection, not show up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fine by me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	had one give us shit for holes in the back door flyscreen from the cat, she left in a hurry after i showed her the flyscreen that was there when we moved in rolled up in the garage lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Lmao just a pile of shreds
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nah they had some heavier duty metal shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but the cats would still poke holes in it over time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's just easier to take it off and replace with cheap shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	put it back on when you move out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i love this
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's like a serving station
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess they needed more shelf space
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i just wanna stick my head through and say "take a seat wherever you'd like ya want some coffee darl?"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	tea pls
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the lighting in there doesn't heklp
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so many rental photos are garbage
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	really is a seller's market
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	having kitchen to dining hole is good though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its a really odd design
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	pity about the face-blocking shelves, but I guess you need them if space is limited
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im going to assume that wall to the right of the first pic is load bearing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ground floor unit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah I guess so
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	shelves should have gone to the ceiling
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	wasting space
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what really bothers me about rental photos is when you can't work out where the fridge goes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	unless you just chuck stuff up there
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh yeah
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fuck that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and when the photos show something the description never mentions
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like that's communal courtyard right
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	right????
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im be that guy living in north adelaide pretending i live in melb

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	surely that entire space is not for that one unit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's the size of the unit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	just put all your furniture out there
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol for real though like what am i gonna do with that much pavement
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Junked car storage
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lmao stacks of tires and a burned out chevvy
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Good luck in ur rental search it's brutal out there
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the mirrors next to the window! why?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im lucky in that im not on a timer
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the only timer is my mental health
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ok yea pretty sure that courtyard adjoins other units
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also looking at streetview there's a balcony of the first floor unit so it'd be hella weird if it was private
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	would be nice if you could show search results on a map like airbnb does
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	in case you're not set on a specific district
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	domain does it best
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	live updates
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ah that's my problem
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	on realestate you have to click a button
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	looking at realestate
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh I see it now
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	only shows up after searching
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its very handy since i am searching for inner burbs but i don't really care where in the inner burbs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's what I thought
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	near train lines n shit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	cool how it just ignores price filters
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	eh?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it includes the max price but the filters work
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	max price seems pretty important
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	one might argue the most important
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	filter: <300pw
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	shows >300pw
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	thanks useless filter
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	weird its worked for me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i actually want it to be inclusive haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since i want to see properties at 300 but not 340
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and a lot of sites don't let you pick a specific number for some reason
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	lazy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	dat planty view
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that kitchen looks out of my budget

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	lots of bench space
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the ledge to sit and shave your legs in the shower is interesting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh just further out than i was looking
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah I was just tracing train lines
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	idk why I'm looking at all
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	more fun when you don't have a stake in it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this perspective fucks me up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the disappearing... stairs?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea they're standing in a place that makes the edging look like its connecting to the cabinet
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	some real escher shit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the decorative grating on whatever that thing is looks like horror game stuff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have no concept of the layout of this unit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh yeah where's the fridge go??
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yoo you're right wtf

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	how do you access the bedrooms
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's where the fridge goes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hahaha thats so inconvenient
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	just pass your shite onto the bench then go into kitchen üòÜ
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	get a benchtop fridge and put it next to the sink
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i was thinking that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	rounding the bench every time you need the fridge
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fuck that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	spilling shit on the carpet

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	one benefit: not having to get on the ground to scrub the shower floor
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	pity about actually using it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	looking forward to falling out of the shower and splitting my head on the tiles
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I worry about that already and my shower is very sensible
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the day the cops find me naked and rotting on the bathroom floor
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i love that i get to make a little profile for my cat
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	hahaha

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	in that it's a cat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The cat you scanned looks 93.2% like a
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Cat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	*Am I right?*
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wait
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they don't fucking have tails
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this was the source of my astonishment
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just found her registration
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	domestic shorthair
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	boring
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	so... cat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yep lamo
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the AAR expects me to remember the password i used when i registered her in 2011
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	laughable
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats some bullshit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i had to apply via 1forms
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then they sent me an email like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	cool man please also apply via 2apply
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	waiting for them to send me a text message saying cool man please also apply via 3mail
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's some bullshit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sounds like time to build a program to port one to the other
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and sell it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well most of the application gets saved to a profile so i think it will be easier moving forward... at least with the agencies using that platform
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also where'd the weekend go
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	damn it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah it be like that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	can't get netflix on my ipad because it requires ios 13+
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but fucking why
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I know this pain
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its doubly stupid because the ipad is on ios 12.5
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	*just upgrade bro*
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	isn't it fun being just one version behind
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its triply stupid because the app works
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and somehow hardware locked out of upgrading
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its just set to not be compatible in the app store
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yep, sucks dick
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	can you install it some way other than app store?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ha ha ha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not in this ecosystem
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	booo
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	emulate a different OS
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its quadruply stupid because this ipad is apparently supported by ios 13
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it won't update to it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	some bullshit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	never mind no its not
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dunno why the fuck i thought this was an air 2 all this time
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it's an air1forms not an air2apply
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ok it's quadruply stupid because the old apps are still available to download *but only if you already downloaded it on another device*
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	why paint dry so quickly on brush or palette but so slooow on mini
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	apparently i can maybe download it with itunes????
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	jesus fucking christ apple is a fucking nightmare
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	could've told you that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and I don't even administrate that shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	unfortunately android tablets blow chunks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have to downgrade my itunes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because they removed the app store from newer versions
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i just want to watch my stories
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh and the website just tells you to download the app i tried that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fuck you twice netflix
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh yeah, reminds me
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I meant to see if there was a way to recover a deleted profile
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	my sister's kid deleted hers
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	which is pretty fucked, since it's my account
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	be good if you could have separate logins for different users
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	deleted her profile on your account or deleted your profile
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	her profile on my account
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	could just as easily have been mine
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they do have different logins for different users support
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	orly
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	might have to implement that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea its called buying another subscription because you're violating their TOS hahaha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	assuming your sis and her kid don't live with you
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	nah that's some bullshit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	we're family
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	how far apart do you have to live to not count anymore?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess the assumption is people in the same house wouldn't delete your profile but i agree thats a big assume
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I mean, it happened in her house, to her
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well its for you and people in your household
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	wouldn't matter if she had her own account or not
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it was a dumb baby thing
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	also she's paying this year
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its weird there's no adult lock on that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its also weird there's no family plan a la spofty
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	seems like they just don't care
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I know people who share across continents without VPNs or anything
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the concurrent screens method seems sensible
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	for now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i read something a couple weeks ago about them implementing new features to stop it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	another sail added to the resurgence of piracy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://gammawire.com/netflix-to-start-testing-warnings-for-people-borrowing-login-info/
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's some bullshit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	is it though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	netflix is so cheap
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm paying for a service, no more than two screens at a time
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	what if my other users only live with me some of the time
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	how do you rule that?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	kids who live across multiple households
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	people who travel a lot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the fact they let you share it at all is already quite permissive
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	may as well drop all accounts to one screen at a time, to make them per-person
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and drop the price (ha ha)
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno it seems reasonable to me. the intent is you're buying a subscription for your house not the people in it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like a cable tv sub
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I would agree with that if there were a one-screen subscription level
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well, they're trying to be *better* than cable
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so everyone in the house can watch different shit at the same time
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but fuck me if I'm only one person
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like yea it would be nice if it was my screen + whoever the hell else i give it to but that's not what they're trying to provide
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ehhh the base price is fine, extra screen is a bonus haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	interesting
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I can't see any mentions of screens anymore
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	maybe it's unlimited now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the base tier doesn't include a second screen
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it also doesn't do HD so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno anyone who would get that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah cause they couldn't put that on the fucking home screen, thanks netflix
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this is why I don't have it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	once again, fuck singles
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea the standard tier seems like the normal tier
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they could drop the basic tier and i don't think anybody would notice
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	probs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno 16 a month for the amount of content they have is a big steal
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and i think if you legitimately can't scrape together 16 bucks a month for your telly you probably have some moral grounds to pirate the content
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	every time I go looking for a specific thing, it's not on netflix üòÜ
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haha yea au netflix is a bit shit compared to us
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its still by far the best service though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	amazon prime video is a joke
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	binge is good if you like HBO and some aussie stuff but that's it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	then again i don't pay for prime video for prime video :think:
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	HBO is the main thing I miss
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they have some good shows
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea binge has a god awful ui on the tv app but can't complain about the content i guess
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	kind of pricey on top of netflix though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	14 bucks
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the idea of churning through them makes sense
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but I'm lazy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	once i move i think i will institute the streaming rotation
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what binge does have that makes it worth the price of admission
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	is generation kill
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which i should really buy on blu ray
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	y'alls startin to look like a bunch of elvises round here
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	POHLEES THAT MOOSTASH
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	:excuseme:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i hear godfather hisself say
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you look like a bum
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nEFLKpknM4
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	love that series so much
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	tldr battalion was having a moustache competition
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but the grooming standards are very clear about moustache regulation
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	sgt maj sixta is just being a cunt so they all have someone to hate
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its about the invasion of iraq
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	based on the autobiography of the rolling stone reporter embedded with them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	good stuff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so i just "bought" (it's free) netflix on itunes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which allowed me to download it directly in the app store on my ipad
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so fucking dumb

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I compromised and threw it away

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	who can tell without cutting it open?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	did it have margarine on its feetsies?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Pregnant, she‚Äôs got HUGE nipples and I (gross but I had gloves on) palpated the abdomen and can feel at least four pups
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I learned to do pregnant mouse exams in animal sci helping my friends thesis haha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I wonder if she died in natural complications from childbirth
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Mousebirth
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	possible
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	She‚Äôs pretty freshly dead when I found her too. Still a bit warm and just beginning to go stiff
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	maybe she playing dead for safety when she saw you
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	lol she's holding out through the exam like "maybe I should've just fuckin run"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	hannah do you ever wonder if you're on telly?

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	accordion is the main one
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fiddle
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	basic flutes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	bound to be some kind of hand percussion, but I can't think of any off the top of my head
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	thigh slaps I guess
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the only accordion i got is the one from the general midi set unfortunately
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's probably fine for this cheesy song but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh for weird percussion im gonna get castanets or something
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	something that sounds like crabs going

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually we do have a keyboard accordion in the garage :think:
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	probably with accordion is you can't play it quietly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i literally never use recorded instruments unless it's commercially available professional recordings but...
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats ok this track is 170bpm with offbeat bass
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its not quiet
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I mean quiet for annoying others
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I learnt Blow The Man Down on this one some years ago
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not well, like everything I learn, but I could dp it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fuck if i care, my back neighbour constantly has loud ass parties, my left neighbour has a kid learning some sort of brass instrument and my right neighbours stole my uber eats one time when it got delivered to them
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I care
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I just don't like being noisy in the middle of the night
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	hell, even in the middle of the day, when I'm inside
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	feels wrong
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i mean im not gonna fish it out of the garage now haha

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno *how* its tuned
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	turns out I can still play that song. nice
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	should learn it on the piano
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fucking accordion air economy + in/out being different notes (on this one)
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	such extra complication
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fff this thing is like 50 years old
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yyyep

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not my precious digital instruments :blobangrypuff:

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I could theoretically play these chords but it would take forever to learn
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Maybe I'll play them one at a time and connect in post
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that would probably easier
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	We'll need to work out what I actually want on it I guess chords is probably the least interesting way to use it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Hit me with accordion music that isn't stereo love

212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	SAPOL are literally cancer. They are the most corrupt police department in the entire history of time. If you call them they will probably not show up. If they do show up they will probably just beat you up, or worse shoot you and throw you in jail where you will probably die. 1000s of people die in SAPOL prison custody every year. #Facts. South Australia and particular Adelaide has become a lawless, basically apocalyptical warzone. I hardly leave my house anymore. Certainly never at night. The other day I'm walking my Jack Russel around the block and I see some kids hanging out the front of Coles, anyway I don't wanna get stabbed so I cross the road to get past but I look over and one of them takes the wrapper off a chupa-chap and just throws it on the ground. THIS KIS WAS JUST LITTERING IN BROAD DAYLIGHT! I squad car drives past and they did nothing. I wanna get out of here if I can. Move to a 3rd world country where I can be safe.

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I'm still not sure what all those little sprouts are, but they're all coming from moss
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	There's two varieties of moss now too, and what looks like an algae
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Shit tons of different types of springtails

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Is the base at an angle perhaps the soils draining in one direction and one plant is missing out/getting too much

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	||Huh. My two first impressions turned out to be right. First, the name Dust reminded me of Hugh Howey's silo series. Even though it's apparently unrelated, and Dust is the whole channel, this film is pretty reminiscent of the books. Second, I thought "she's not wearing a shirt under that jacket"||

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Then I stretched it and part of it unraveled
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Then I had to repair it with non matching yarn and it got warped
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	And here we are
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôve given up completely

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Finding them a month later and no idea what I was doing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	starting over with a new stitch and it doesn‚Äôt match the rest
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sounds like you need to pin notes to things
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Repeat ad infinitum
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I used to! Then I just started ignoring them and not leaving myself good notes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Some people do puzzles, I guess this is what I do
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	knitting is much easier to put away
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	can always unravel a given-up piece, right?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôd like to see someone stuff a puzzle down the side of the couch and pull it out later to work on
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	A lot of my yarn used to be something lmao
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I think of it as reincarnation
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	ReinYarnation

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Bruh
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Tbh sometimes I'm happiest at work because for a few hours I'm not responsible for the health and happiness of two children.
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	You got no reason to tho unless you are overburdened by the responsibility for the health and happiness of your Miku figurines
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	A Miku is for life, not just for Christmas.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	seems a bit reductive (sometimes folks have problems beyond kids), but maybe the move to own place will help
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im an introvert and i haven't had a chance to recharge lately with my brother here
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	at least that's what im chalking it up to

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	look forward to it passing I guess
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Life can be going great and U still feel sad and stressed brains be that way
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Being reminded of rad stuff in your life helps doe

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i said i couldn't work out if was textured or jpeg compressed
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I was more interested in cafeteria serving kitchen place

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because i never even need the 3 prep days a fortnight but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno having said that it might be saving my skin now that our classes have milled out and they could combine them if they wanted to
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	mm maybe

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I hear there's gonna be a teaching position up for grabs at blackwood next year
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	don't think blackwood has a game design curriculum

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hahaha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but that's probably the closest you'd get

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dunno what happened to them

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its probably about time i got tighter with money
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	man, you go out a bit further (ok a fair bit further) and the please get much roomier and homier

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	something i learned recently is that like 99%  of all medical helo flights are just transfers for trauma patients
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	This one I think was a rescue maybe, they literally ran this guy out of the helicopter and people ran up to meet it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Also they do a lot of organ transplant transfers via helicopter so sometimes it‚Äôs just one guy with a box of kidneys
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i had this vision of em picking people up in the woods and shit but when you think about it it wouldn't be cost effective to have em fueled up and ready for just that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i guess transfers in general, organs and patients
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	when road is too slow
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I wonder if they had to stabilise this person bc when they opened the doors random trash flew out like they‚Äôd been opening sterile stuff during the flight

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	landlord is open to talking about selling it to us but is currently on stress leave from work so wants some time to sort through that before doing something big like selling
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	the hoses keep breaking ü§î

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	worst case they say no and you get to make new plans for a different place which is also fun

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	neither of us have much appetite for a whole-house reno job
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	these are nice problems to have doe
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	at least we're in a position where we (think) we can buy something

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	isn't that just a rotary tool with a drill bit in it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it is indeed
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but this one is *small*

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	probs fits the bits from my cordy one too, but this has smaller drill bits than any I had so far
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not very strong, so I feel a bit safer using it close to my hands
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	can easily just grab it and it stops without hurting me (lol fuck you motor)
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nice

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yeah ten speeds that‚Äôs right
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	5k, 10k, 15k
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the lady who sold it to me was like ‚Äúten speeds honey‚Äù so that‚Äôs a selling point
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	10 speeds is a fun selling point, but who ends up using more than one, really?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I guess 10 speeds give you the option to choose your favourite
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like I don't really need 15k for drilling resin
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	needs a favourite recall mode

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	no fan though, boooo
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	do americans not have normal oven ranges
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Gets that nice brown top
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yes but they also have toaster ovens in the same way people here buy air fryers
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	my folks have one. it gets stuff piled on it mostly
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Just extra stuff
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	We never had a toaster my whole life just toaster ovens
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the one at work is handy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I still don‚Äôt have a toaster
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	weird!
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The oven grill part is the same thing!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea but an air fryer works differently to a normal oven, that's just a tiny oven
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	though i guess a benchtop oven with a fan would basically be an air fryer
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	we‚Äôve come full circle
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	air fryer is a tiny fan forced oven
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	toaster oven is slightly less tiny un-fan-forced oven
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	good for browning and crisping, but ugh baking without fan is slooow
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea but i haven't seen an oven without a grill function for crisping
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	would be handy if your oven didn't include a grill section
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	snap

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	maybe
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think modern ovens have that part inside the oven proper, instead of a separate drawer above
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ya
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I have that seperate drawer above

I felt drawn into a void! I didn't know at the time that what really happened was the mind-made self, with its heaviness, its problems, that lives between the unsatisfying past and the fearful future, collapsed. It dissolved. The next morning I woke up and everything was so peaceful. The peace was there because there was no self. Just a sense of presence or "beingness," just observing and watching. ----- What you perceive as a dense physical structure called the body, which is subject to disease, old age, and death, is not ultimately real - is not you. It is a misperception of your essential reality that is beyond birth and death, and is due to the limitations of your mind, which, having lost touch with Being, creates the body as evidence of its illusory belief in separation and to justify its state of fear.```

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	New vs old. LEDs are A LOT nicer, much better colour range
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	typefeel is great
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	red switches are so good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this ones are a lot more quiet
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think more to do with materials since they are both apparently gateron reds
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so good to have arrow keys back

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i already work 32
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i mean i don't actually work 32 it's more like 24 but
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ah. That's a fair bit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	$$$ tho

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i used to work there so i know the kind of work and what i can get away with billing lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	This is my solution for everything
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	including insides

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	years ago

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	right lmao also learned a good lesson about chemicals tho so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	can't believe they're holding us down by poisoning our ethanol like this

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I can't believe everyone wasting all this ethanol on drinkable spirits when they could be cleaning with it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I just saw that in trending gifs and clicked it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Metho can clean anything
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	likely story
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Even my soul
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you've been holding that gif for weeks
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Well anything that's soluble in alcohol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Waste of time on most adhesives
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	anything that isn‚Äôt can be cleaned with fire
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Fire is the best sanitiser
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I love autoclave
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	S
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	godliness in a machine
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	no microbe for u
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ooh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what the fuck
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	alt and win key are swapped
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	whaaaaaaat
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Swap em back
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	you keyboard people noticing where keys are
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	amazing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I don‚Äôt know what the win key does
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	opens start
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i use it a lot
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	oh lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and some other shortcuts i don't use much because i have other things that do it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the little "swap to windows" (came with keycaps for mac) card shows the alt in the right spot
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Wait til you try using a windows keyboard for mac stuff. Doesn't take too long to adjust to the "apple" key being in the wrong spot, but I pity my colleague who switches between win and mac keyboards weekly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it's swapped electrically or in firmware
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i use a macbook
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	What the fuck
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but the way you use a macbook is quite different to windows
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so it never catches me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what does always catch me is the lack of a delete key
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or rather, the backspace key is called delete
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	My Bluetooth speaker just vibrated itself off the counter
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	that was my what the fuck
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well, the way you use a macbook is quite different to how you use a desktop windows pc i should say
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	https://youtu.be/s-7cHTcbhVU
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I use the same programs at home on win, so use ctrl as the modifier at home and win/apple to modify at work. And if i use anybody else's kb at work, the apple key is in the "wrong" spot
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	With you on the backspace thing
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	IT'S NOT THE SAME FUNCTION, APPLE
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	U can swap keys at os level for mac
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Also home key doesn't work in most native programs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i just bought a 150 dollar keeb so i didn't have to function + some key to delete like you do on a mac
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	HOME DOESN'T MEAN PAGE UP, FUCKWITS
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i say as if i didn't buy the 60% knowingly
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Oh here's a question for ya
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	3
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Are the keys painted on the inside or outside?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	why would they paint them on the inside
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Because this
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ok but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if they painted them on the inside you couldn't ssee the colour üòÑ
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but yea that's normal for abs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	plus that shiny look you got going
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	My home keyboard admittedly isn't as heavily used in one spot, but it's 1000000 years older, wroth no visible wear
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's not abs then
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably PBT or something
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	abs is a lot cheaper
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Pretty sure home one is clear with the print inside or embedded
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	This is printed outside. Visibly.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im pretty sure the keys aren't painted, it's dye just not through the whole thing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	except the legend
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which is usually pad painted
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this one the black is raised above the clear
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that looks like double shot abs though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which is why your key legends are still visible
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	https://tenor.com/view/icehouse-gif-18830788
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Double shot as in two moulds?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Can‚Äôt stop listening to icehouse
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Dies
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Anyway the new one looks nice
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	doubleshot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	pad painted key legends wear out fast
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	At first i thought you were saying the smaller one was the new one (reading order top to bottom) and i didn't like it :P
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeah the new one is a lot better
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	weird layout aside
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also gonna take me a while to get used to keys being right next to enter and backspace
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Old one looks cramped
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Lack of numpad though.  I know that's teensy now but i hate it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	didn't feel cramped, just missing dedicated buttons for stuff i wanted
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Trendy. Not teensy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the first time i missed my numpad was playing arma lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Thank

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Haha George would be so confused why our kb is missing a key tomorrow
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Not that he'd ever use that key anyway
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i o u microscope pix george : )
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i am a fucking lemon
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i was trawling the internet looking for a solution to do a thing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	render all the selected media files via the master channel so it applied the effects
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	getting frustrated
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	spent about 20 mins
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	was using this option
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then i saw
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fuck my life why did this not show up in my search
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe nobody else has had the same problem before
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Because they looked in the dropdown
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	üòÜ
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol i guess so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dunno how the fuck i missed it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i had to open the drop down to get to that first option so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	finally got a good workflow going for doing TTS >FX Chain>Game though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so that's nice
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Winning eventually

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Banana cake with toffee/cream icing
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I had two pieces
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	TIL banoffee has nothing to do with coffee
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Hahahaha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Oh god
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Schnook: oh nah I won't have the banoffee I gotta get to bed early Schnooks dinner companions: :what:
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I already don't like banana, so I didn't miss out on anything
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Eat toffee cream icing from a bowl then
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ok
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	when my life score is added up at the end, I'll say those -10 points are because jugs told me to
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Banana smoothie with coffee in it is fucking excellent though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not because I just wanted to eat icing >_>
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	You get bonus points for that, not minus
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	That's called LIVING

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	man I offered some wingless drosophila cultures
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Nobody wanted em

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I have a million tiny flying things in his room, but i never see him hunt
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I get it nobody wants wingless flies in their fridge it‚Äôs not a fun adventure tbh
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe i go buy bait mealworms?

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I figured fly or moth would be perfect. Easy to catch, juicy.
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Winged prey superior for apex predators
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	According to mantis discord
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Maybe U can find a small beetle and disable it for him
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	My plan was to freeze to kill then thaw and leave it out for him
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Or if moth maybe just pin wings to something.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Mean :(

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Though i guess it's not really crawling if you're on your feet. Do we just say things are crawling if they have more than four legs? Or is it because they're close to the walking surface (relative to us, not relative to them)
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	no moths, but I did find this huge ant dying on my doorstep
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I was just trying out all my shakiest moji
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	settled on menacing as you can see
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	is it too early for spider news?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I unintentionally stressed horsie last night by chasing him around for minutes trying to get him to go look at moth
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	idk how spiders think
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like he clearly did not like, but he never ran away from the stick I kept poking at him
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	would still climb on, then jump off when in the air
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	anyway I eventually got him to go in the little tray I put the moth on
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	then I saw later he was still there, and the moth had stopped moving, so I *think* he had a feed
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	should have put the tray a bit lower so I can see into it without a mirror
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	last time i did and they got it wrong as well
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	theres a folder in this folder im workin on called 'TUMOUR PHOTOS' and its from 2010

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the desk clamps on these look like they wouldn't hold up to any sideways force

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the clamps themselves are good, but cheapies often have sloppy arms
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea this one's "neck" the bit right behind the vesa clamp is a bit iffy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have to tighten it after a few weeks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not a big deal
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	worst case the monitor just angles down a bit
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Do you move it a lot? If not, retightening it might eventually kill it completely
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea, i move it to the front of the desk when im watching a movie on my couch-bed

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	boss uses his quest pretty much exclusively for racing I think
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I like racing but cbf
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah my pal i bought the chair off does drifting, I tried his, is great
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	man i am getting frustrated youd think that like 14 pages of workflow documentation with step by step instructions and screenshots would be enough
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	"can you make an 'extra help' page for workflow settings
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	okay
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	its just gonna click straight back to the workflow part
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	hehehehe
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh god WFs and SOPs my nightmare
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i have made this 49 page document painstakingly
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	with feedback and input from every single person here that is a user
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and everyones stuck on the same stuff so that means i need to rewrite it OR automate the tricky part so nobody has to do it by hand
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	even got everyones e signatures finally authorised and verified
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	this is the LAST step
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i wish i had some sort of graphic or creative design training because man i am not good at making visually smooth instructional documents lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I have a little training in that and I still can't make things look decent
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Thats like, the one thing Im good at
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I really like Confluence. There's a free tier Han, but it doesnt export to docx or pdf as nicely as it looks on web. Might still be a useful intermediary
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	confluence ayyyyy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	thank u i go google
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	my eyes feel like theyre gonna pop out

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	no die han
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	no time to die too many workflow instructions to write
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	https://tenor.com/view/cat-laptop-fast-homework-apple-gif-5315897
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I got you this song for your current predicament https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZjpWs1h7pU
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	make templates be consistent use win-shift-s or greenshot or something actually useful for screenshots
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	this part of the instruction is only for me since im the only portal admin
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	why did i include it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	page 51: enabling special access for regulatory authorities
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	im dying
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	im making two factor authentication optional because already three people have used their personal phones and not their work phones for authentication
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	smh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	how did this job also become security/process development on top of archiving shit and sending through regulatory documents
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	oh well lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Is that even unique to your org? If its another vendors product, just link to their documentation.
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i am lol but i might just remove the two factor auth completely from our archive module
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	we arent putting anything on there that requires approval to see (only access for people already approved)
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so idc
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Are you sure it's not there because of legal requirements around auth for accessing health data
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	nah we arent putting patient data on the archive module for this product
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	we are allowed to but  boss wants manual archive for pt data
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so i worked out technically everything uploaded here already has e-sig certified audit logs for every single click
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so it doesnt matter if its 2fa or not
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	cos if ur on there ur logged anyway 4eva
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	You're making me uncomfortable Han... you're confusing authentication and authorisation lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	its like, investigator site files given to us from trial companies
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	oh yeah probably
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i dont have any real cyber training
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	is ok I just wont think about it

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	property manager replied about cat saying they will know next week but i should come to the open inspection today
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's a CBD apartment
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the inspection is at 1230 üôÉ
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	got the email at 1159
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	wow
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	really helpful guys
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Nice
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the pre-application is asking if i have any other active applications... do you think another pre-application counts üòÑ
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I don't know what they want to achieve by asking that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably sort me to the bottom of the acceptable tenants list because i might back out
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	so then say no I guess
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	god what a painful game
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess the only way they know assuming there isn't some secret "agencies using the same system can check if you're lying" is if i back out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fuck it i think there's reasonable doubt there given i haven't inspected the other property yet
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the cbd apartment is NRAS which is the only reason it's in my budget
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im fucked if i get a new job
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	"come by in half an hour with half an hours notice, cheers cunt good luck"

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	won't listen for modifiers when configuring but can swap them still
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	got my windows and alt keys swapped back üôè
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also i bought a few miku coloured SA caps for replacing the incorrect legends on my delete/end binds
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	will see how i like em
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I basically abandoned the hobby after I got the nk65 and didnt want to touch it. Still got the printed keeb to finish one day
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	DAE buy stuff and then just go why did I buy this
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea im not treating it like a hobby i just wanna have a keyboard i don't have any issues with
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its too expensive and too uhh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno what the fuck you do with multiple keyboards
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	at least with trains i get to build "art" y'know
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I used to have keeb money
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	then i got kids
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Yeah I never planned to make it long term but did wanna find my ideal keyboard. Just cbf tho, that's a lot of effort for minor improvement

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	My prediction: the big companies are going to start watching the artisan/niche/enthusiast companies and do it better cheaper
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	well nah already happening to some degree
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	and tbh some of these manufacturers deserve to get stomped
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno, mkb community seems to aim for non-standard and/or less keys, which doesn't sell well en masse
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	more keys = better to the average consumer
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Logi have been doing more and more tkl and compact
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't think tkl is really non standard though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	laptops made it mainstream
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Well other than like the 60% its pretty easy to find compact mainstream
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i had a sidewinder keyboard in 2011 that had a detachable numpad :deepfriedcrylaughing:
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Ive still got this broken G613 here I keep meaning to fix
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	why do I do this to myself?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i operate the numpad as a sci fi datapad in a mate's uni film which you will not have the displeasure of watching
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i still fucking miss that calculator button
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	guys when i move
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im gonna get a cat bed

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ive only briefly used the hololens 2 but i did a bunch of work with the og one and it really is some lext level shit https://twitter.com/MicrosoftDesign/status/1392855087031017472
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I gave up trying to make Cat spots she just picks her own
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	she loves the dog spots tho
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	damn dude
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	as i understand it, right is missiles fired from gaza, left is the israeli iron dome missiles launching to intercept
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	iron dome is basically missile command the game but irl
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	shoot missiles to shoot missiles down
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it's semi or totally automated launch systems, the computers work out if the missile(s) its tracking will hit populated areas and launch intercept if so
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Heard all this clattering and yelling and was like shit, there's a brawl in the alley
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	It's a bunch of school kids skateboarding, cool
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I didn't know this was still cool, but it's cool that it is

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	a murder chamber
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	possibly!
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	my first thought was greenhouse
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	spammers don't know me at all if they think i want this

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Nah fancy
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	We stopped tho, learned some cool new tricks
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	My compost is so bad rn it's more like an organic tyre fire
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is how PSO2 NGS gets around naming it "male" and "female" lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	did you just assume my creature class??
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they did remove all gendered restrictions that base PSO2 has, so you can do this sort of grossness
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	5head
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	do you want common teeth or wonderful teeth
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ah yes, wonderful when all teeth fill the front of the mouth, instead of following the jaw
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all the expressions have always looked gross and NGS is no exception
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	NGS is this weird separate game to PSO2 but runs on the PSO2 engine
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	apparently in 2014 they changed the law to say that tenants have to pay for usage and supply of water, not just usage
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://tenor.com/view/why-huh-but-why-gif-13199396
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	because fuck tenants probably
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i asked the guy about water costs today and he was like yea every landlord is doing it now
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm not sure I even paid for usage back in the day unless it was "exceptional"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but if the garden looks good in inspections the landlord might be convinced to pay for a portion to maintain it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea you paid for excess
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	136 kilolitres a year prior to 2014
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	paying for usage is totally fair
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	https://www.thewildfoodhuntress.com.au/lactarius-deliciosus
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	though i think the landlord should pay a portion for expected maintenance
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	just checked my last 4 bills
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	69KL total
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they probably framed it as "pay water bill so landlord doesn't pocket the profit if you're under" except it's not like the weekly rental cost ever went down to compensate
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	basically free money for landlords
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess if i was in apartment i'd not be paying supply
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but then i'm probably paying for an even split instead which is only good if you take 20 minute showers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also how fucking weird are open inspections in an occupied house
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	feels hella gross
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like oh cool now i know they didn't finish putting their washing away before the inspection
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and that they like shitty rom coms
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	felt like some sort of weird museum experience
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is how people lived in 2021
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not sure the math checks out on this one

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well im not going to do any of that but i will mess about with the map since i've done basically none of that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but first i will reply to this email i forgot about
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	helping kids with their research projects :disgust:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i never did research project but as i understand it you can like... do whatever the fuck you want as long as you answer some kind of research question
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like if you wanna just shoot a rad skateboarding video you can just ask "how do you film, edit and publish a skateboarding video?"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	obviously you have to describe it and do some research but then your chief evidence is your rad skateboarding video and the rest is just peripheral
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it seems like most kids ask some high level question like "how does underaged drinking affect the developing mind" and have a miserable time and achieve nothing of value
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess it probably depends on if your teacher is a cunt
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Mm it appeared after my time, but my school did a similar thing in year 10, which was pretty much "pick a thing to prove you can do a bunch of research and present your findings to an audience"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	didn't seem like a big deal at the time, but I guess now it's curriculum, kids get all thingy about it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because it's a sace requirement i think
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so it feels like a big deal
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Our version seemed pretty cool at the time, because we got allocated time daily to work on something we were interested in
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	presenting to the public, less fun, but still a bit fun
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	bing is such fucking garbage lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	sorry in hindsight ultrawide side by side is mean for screenshot
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	who uses bing for things other than porn?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	why would you use bing for porn
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	apparently it has video previews that mean you can avoid going to cancerous porn sites
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and the previews are actually the whole video
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	stuff like that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	might be different now
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that was some years ago
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well i use edge for work since we have office 365 accounts
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and its just what the default search is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably you can change it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have not
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway this kid's research question is ‚ÄúHow have the worlds in action-adventure video games been created in a professional environment?‚Äù
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and i know there's an interview component which i'm solving for him
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i hope the rest of his project was just playing uncharted or something
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like, how do devs make the actual game environment?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	his questions were What do level designers do to make the player feel immersed? What processes do level designers go through in preproduction? What are the core principals of level design? How do level designers refine their levels?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i dunno how it ties into the rest of his project
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	me dumb monkey just answer question
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	mm I can see how some of that could be answered
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Q1 and 3 are of interest
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually those ones are the worst questions
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but I enjoy!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the other two have concrete answers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	those two will vary dramatically between designers and company
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	what about immersing the player in concrete?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	made illegal in the boston accords unfortunately
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	do you wanna see my answers

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah garn post answers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fuck that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is the link https://80.lv/articles/a-look-at-blockouts-in-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Guidance is a thing I didn't really consider (along with everything really) until I played Valve games with commentary
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	since having them point out all the things they did to make sure the player knew wtf to do, I get lost in games a lot less
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the guidance is supposed to be organic, and sometimes it's annoying always recognising that things were placed *for* me, but but it is handy to know what to look for
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	also gating
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea often looking behind the curtain ruins the magic
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the main things like i said are colour and contrast
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	contrast is the big one though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if something looks different to the stuff around it, it's interactable in some way
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or it's a poorly designed level
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the coolest use of contrast IMO is negative space
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's a cool example we go over in class i can't really show you but basically we go over how the gap between two buildings looks oh so inviting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh and in non-linear games, forcing the player through environmental chokepoints to force them to look at something is very handy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like i dunno you go through a tunnel; the designer knows exactly what you can see when you exit that tunnel
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then ubisoft open world just says no fuck good map design we'll just fucken plaster markers on everything
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	honey it's 4pm time for your laundry list check off
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha yep
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	all these things
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ooh another ruining the illusion thing: learning that hallways were level loaders
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	lot of stuff in gen2 tomb raider games made a lot more sense after that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I keep forgetting cornflakes exist
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	A constant struggle

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I got pepper sprayed today
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not really, but it was going that way
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	went to D&D at someone's house, their housemate cooked something with a lot of chilli, burnt it a bit, everybody in the house spent the next hour or two coughing and sneezing
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm surprised how bad it was
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	didn't smell that bad, but damn
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	my nose feels raw like after having a cold for a week
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Haha jeez
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	FINALLY I got my prescription for modafinil
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Legally from the aus doctors
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Milestone
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	My old housemate did that!! Put dried chilis in a hot pan before cooking
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	we had to sit outside for an hour clutching the cats coughing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	house was unenterable
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	aw kitty
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Did you get it for sleep stuff or other reason?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	brain finished already lol that was a good week
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I told the dr I‚Äôd been taking it for years and I wanted a script, and she was like ‚Äúoh okay we can do a private non pbs script it will cost over $100 is that okay‚Äù and I said yes
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it was that easy lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	lol score
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some kickback for the doc or something so it was a win win

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	~~sith~~ big pharma
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I think they‚Äôre just concerned bc it has variable side effects about prescribing privately for the first time but bc I said I‚Äôd been taking it with no side effects and it helped me she was just like ‚Äúcool‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	She was also very young
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so maybe young doctors are better
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Like probably younger than me she looked about 22
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	haha just intimidated "she does health science and she's older I should probs just go with it"
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	lmao I find when you see a doc and say you need a repeat and overwhelm them with verbal info about your history of taking that med they kinda just glaze over and are like ‚Äúok this person won‚Äôt die from this and I won‚Äôt get sued just print the script‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Most of their prescribing duties are just to make sure they aren‚Äôt prescribing something that will immediately make you feel shit and come back angry
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	according to my dr friend anyway that‚Äôs the go with a lot of functional psych drugs lmao
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	which is ethically not great
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But I get it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	They‚Äôre busy
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	lol yeah thats why I bailed on my gp who was like "huh? who are you? hello yes. depression? take this. who are you again?"
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Plus I wasn‚Äôt asking for a drug of dependence as modafinil had been down scheduled from s8 to s4 lucky for me
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oh god
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That‚Äôs terrible
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I later realised his speciality was paediatrics, so he was used to dealing with parents more than patients
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oh noooo
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I had a dr for a while who always asked me about my neck and back randomly during appts and I found out like years later her training specialty was in osteo and spinal stuff
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but she became a psychiatrist lmao
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it made me paranoid for a while like ‚Äúare these meds damaging my spinal column why is she asking this‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I hope you find a good one
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	If you need meds on demand I recommend qoctor
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	you can also start a new short script entirely with them very little questions asked if you want to try a med, don‚Äôt say that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing but they are willing to prescribe decent psych meds on monthly basis to trial
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	unless you specifically schedule a repeat consult then they can prescribe it long term
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôve used them before and they‚Äôre actually the least bad doctors on demand type service, with very good customer service
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I got a good GP now
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	U saying I did all that rambling for nothing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	:LSG:
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	as usual tbh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	don‚Äôt lose ur good doc if they try to move to another state just steal their dog
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	day one of programming module today
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	exhausting to teach
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its just full on "this is what you do" and answering questions for people who fell behind and didn't say anything
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fun
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its only tolerable because you get to see the ones who actually try eyes light up when you explain something they didn't get
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then there's the ones who don't make any friends and sit alone and don't ask for help from me or the other students and it's like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that alone is basically you saying you're not fit to be a designer
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's no kind of game designer where you don't spend a lot of time talking with people and getting their opinions and feedback
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and i can't teach you to have social skills lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	god forbid haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm watching some people play a game
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	exploring a room, one of the first things: "can you use the toilet?"

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the other one came before it: "oh great the mirrors don't work"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	(I don't know if you mentioned that one but I consider it a metric)
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	shitty non-realistic mirrors are easy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats usually good enough
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	deus ex style
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	emphasis on shitty
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	you can almost excuse it if it's in a believably dirty/broken environment
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but this is in a fancyarse architect's pristine house
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they went to the effort of making the mirror frame beautiful
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	maybe it's not meant to be mirror
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	because protag hates his face
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i never asked for this

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	was closing notepad++ tabs and found a dream i wrote down
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	here's the second half > Round the corner and now I'm in some sort of 19th century hotel. I have urgency to get away so I'm jogging through the hallways, where there seems to be a lot of young kids from some sort of foreign private school. I want to say russian. They're running about and causing a ruckus. One in particular is running away from the madame of the hotel(???) who is a middle aged woman in a period-relevant frilly dress and hat. I come to what appears to be the top of the grand stairs of the hotel, where a bunch of these kids are. That one kid is boasting about how he escaped the madame, and I sidle past onto the stairs, just walking now. The madame is coming up the stairs and as we pass I bow and say 'Ma'am' but in that british way that is more like mahm than mam. As i descend the stairs it turns out the ground floor is some kind of art gallery, and I have the understanding that it is the 'Conche de' something and is very famous. Im in france. A woman is singing on a microphone, a lovely tune i cannot remember anything about. The walls are glass and I can see that indeed it is paree fronce. I step outside of the glass door into the streets of paris and I see the notre-dame being rebuilt. I have the immediate feeling that Im expriencing something really powerful, that this is why Im travelling (apparently Im travelling). Images of the motifs that are being carved into the new stonework flash before me and they're like, memes. Modern memes. I don't recall any of them. Then I awake to the sound of my cat meowing directly into my ear.
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	St Andrews hospital just reached out thru my coworker to ask if I‚Äôm interested doing database coord for them as well remotely a couple days a fortnight

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	those friends who always say "hey we should carpool" when they really mean "you need to drive me" and when you can't or don't want to, or even make a joke about it, they act like you're the arsehole
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	when you are done there is a pic 4 u in #pictures-of-cool-things
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I saw I love
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	sounds like mfers need to learn how to ask for a lift
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh they do, every damn time, but they phrase like this
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	last time they said "carpool?" I said "sure, who's driving?" and they got all hnnneeuughjhh as if I'd asked them for their firstborn
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	literal entitlement
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	problem is if I back them into a corner and they have to drive, they're more annoyingly tense about driving than I am annoyed about driving
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	unless I manage to go separately altogether
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's the dream
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	are they the kind of people who will take "how about you stop being wankers and ask for a lift like normal people" as an attack on their existence
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	even if fuck environment and parking fees I guess
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	probably yes
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	do my trick, never go anywhere or do anything or talk to anyone
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that was kind of what I meant by "sure who's driving" last time
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that works pretty well for me
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but it's scotty's birthday

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not enough to matter
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well that's something, it would be double shit if they were just assuming you were desso because you didnt
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I will accede this time but make her plan the parking
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I kinda assumed that was the situation, wtf is the situation if its not a deso thing
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	mostly a "you're less AnXiEtY so you do it" even though if I weren't going they would just suck it up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm just grumpy because I hate stopping, hate the city, hate factoring in other people

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm totally not the arsehole here
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I do it almost every time, I just hate it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	mostly for the assumption that it's my job

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that might solve one problem but create a bunch more
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	though I think this is going to be less frequent next year
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they're moving back to the riverland
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	so my social life will decline, since they're always the instigators üòÜ

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea we've been fighting for that for only about 30 years
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	All to become a bullet point in an email
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Congrats tho
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It got more coverage in gamedev specific news
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's only for established companies though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	500k pa revenue or something
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So hopefully it drives the big studios to reopen their Australian studios
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Which all closed GFC
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Sledgehammer (call of duty) is the only AAA studio in Australia and it's not even their main studio
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	interesting
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	didn‚Äôt realize how political this area was
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But I guess what isn‚Äôt
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Big $$
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Canada, UK, a few us states have similar rebates
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So why run a studio in expensive Australia
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Where you gotta pay people decent money :capabilitieslaser:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Vic already had a state pdv which is why most of the studios are there
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I was actually on an industry panel when the state gov changed with some of the local big(ger) studios and the department was like ok what do you need
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And everyone is like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Give us money
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And stop taking the money we make
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	:deepfriedcrylaughing:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Meanwhile we're talking to the department of trade, investment, high tech and creative industries or some shit
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	:pepeaaaaaaagh: :oh_no:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Basically just tack some other shit onto the dept of trade because why not
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Wow
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I did not know this
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Tbh though the libs did a decent job
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	They did do kind of what we said
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And I do wonder if this federal rebate is coming up the chain from state
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	When they took government they shit canned the labour games funding overnight
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	:thinkception:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And then six months later they legally classed games as a screen media
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Which meant that the SAFC could now fund games
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So it's all in all been positive
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Labour dragged their feet on that for a decade
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	On the other hand, I'm a human bean before I'm an entrepreneur so fuck voting lib
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So the office at lot 14
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The toilets are on the wrong end of a secure door
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I fucking hate that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	What's the point nobody can get to the toilets without going through a secure door in the first place so like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Just why
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Also the button to open the secure door is inconveniently far away from the door itself
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Also @Sigil no dox in the other server but :capabilitieslaser: :capabilitieslaser: :capabilitieslaser:

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	He‚Äôs not driving anywhere and his tolerance is astronomical
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I would haha that can be full on when unexpected
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Could just end up being a good day
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Or he might be taking bloods at clinic so it could be a disaster
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	No work?

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	@HotelAlphaNectar my GFs sisters friend has a bunny on a leash at cafe komodo
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Is this as fucked as I think it is
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yes.
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Is she there like right now with the bunny bc these are prime rabbit sleeping hours, this is like our 3am for them, it‚Äôs stressful and mean to keep them up and out during bright hours outside their home. Most bunnies hate leashes too...and a cafe is not the place for a bunny obviously
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	plus if that bun eats any coffee bean or grounds on the ground it can die really easily and fast
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oh man I‚Äôm mad now
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Hurrhurr rabbits are easy cute fuzzballs no worries
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah idk when it is but it looks hot and theyre walking around the carpark with it. snapchat
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	NO they are highly attuned and alert prey animals on a hair trigger
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	What the fUCK
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Just out in the bright sun with birds flying overhead no cover. How to give a rabbit a heart attack or stress induced severe problems
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	im just not looking forward to saying something about it cos shes gonna get personally offended that I think her friend should be nicer to his pet and its gonna become family scale drama
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	fuck it sent it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	My approach is to gently ask how much they know about rabbits requirement and if they want more resources on keeping their bunny happy and stress free, then I ramble about how easily they get stressed and how well they hide it and guilt them into understanding that they‚Äôre maintaining a constant state of terror and anxiety on a sentient being and they could easily intervene and stop
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	build up until they realise they‚Äôre essentially torturing a very sensitive animal
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	an animal that is a MUCH better and happier pet when it‚Äôs actually treated with respect
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	smh poor bun good on you for saying something

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im doing some writing for defender and i was like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well you can't FTL through the belt because rocks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then it occured to me that you could just FTL around the belt since it's a donut
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i'm not changing it so i guess it will just get joked about in game somehow
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	whats the term for that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like intentionally drawing attention to plot holes or weirdness

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	well he sure did experience work
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	work is technically just anything that uses energy so we ticked all the boxes there
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Great success
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its ya boi
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	But is it vr?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the game is from 2004
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they basically packed a mini ps2 into the controller
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its not actually a ps2 but it has the power of one
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the game was on ps2 originally
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	And that's the only game on it, or multiple?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its just that
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	thats awesome
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Such a funny concept to me
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Seems a waste of hardware
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Should put doom on it somehow
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's an arcade game turned console game turned plug and play game
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so single use controller makes sense based on that lineage
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can also get ps2 controllers like it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and they look almost exactly the same
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Do they have a sandwich slot where the computer guts should be?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	eh?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Well if they use the same body, there should be a void where the ps2-esque computer isn't. Naturally: snack hole
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well no the controllers are 15 years old so the electronics are bigger lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that said i don't think there's any electronics below the stopwatch holder
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which can function as a totally useless small can holder
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Oh that's what that recess is haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the brake lever fouls it so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can't actually put a can there and play
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Mm just what i need - putting liquid containers directly *on* my electronics
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	live like the yamanote line drivers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	on the edge
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Sorry that reference went over me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the train in the picture
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	is an E231 series
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which are best known for servicing the yamanote line
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which is the busiest line in tokyo
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I have a succulent in a glass bottle with water in it on top of my PC at work, just to unsettle people
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	and show my care and finesse
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Gently warming the water
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Heard something in the news recently about a bullet train driver leaving his spot while the train was travelling because he had the shits. Got in trouble but everything was fine.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	he left it with the conductor so it wasn't totally unmanned
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but the conductor wasn't licenced
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah seems like if you can't leave it for a sec you need a copilot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also the system is so ridiculously safed that even if he had dropped dead at the controls the train would have just slowly braked to a stop
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah that's what i thought
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and all the trains behind it would have automatically had their speed targets reduced too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	crazy connected and smart
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	tohoku line shinkansen drivers basically just play follow the needle with the throttle
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the system tells them an exact speed to go to to maintain the timetable
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	did i say tohoku
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	At which point, couldn't it just be automated, with someone babysitting it just in case
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i mean tokaido
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea totally
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there is some cultural pushback to automated vehicles though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Give the driver some numbers to input every 10 minutes to prove he's there
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	a la Lost
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i never watched lost
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	every time i caught an ep on tv some random shit was happening
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	It's for the best
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i only remember the fat guy

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i knew it was one of the goofy big movie guys
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	If i didn't already know it was a massive timesink, I'd consider chronological
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	There was some great stuff in it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Just wasn't the majority imo
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	you can probably watch a 45 minute youtube video that gives you all the important stuff
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think i only started watching to get the references that were in just cause 2
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Just gimme 45 minutes of Sawyer being a cunt with his shirt off and Faraday being awesome but sad
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Tbh take away all the supernatural and spooky company stuff and it might still be fun
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I love Robinson Crusoe sprites
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i rewatched generation kill last week after it came up a while ago and it remains excellend
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Stories
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Anime?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nEFLKpknM4
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	y'all startin ta look like elvises
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ah. Will look at home.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	HBO. recon marines invading iraq. clusterfuck
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Damn hbo having all the good shows
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	based on irl, fairly accurate besides some characterisations
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Or... damn fox i guess
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also unrelated but i started book 4 in the red rising series tonight
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	audio book style
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i wish i had not
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Orly?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	trilogy ended fairly well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	book 4 i guess starts a new trilogy 10 years later with multiple points of view
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and the audiobook uses different narrators for each point of view
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	noped out fast
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't mind multiple pov stories but not when the last 3 have been single pov
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Same author?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it should have started with not the main character from the last 3 book's pov
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because that set the tone
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then suddenly we're pov from someone random you've never heard of
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Mm an interesting choice
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the trilogy i would recommend if you want some soft-ish sci fi and don't mind it being a bit YA
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I like it when cameos show up layer and you get to go "ohhhhh!" and point
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there is a lot of BUT ACTUALLY MC KNEW ALL ALONG
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's a few really eye rolly events like that but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	overall i enjoyed it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I don't know if it's the trilogy I'm thinking of, but a friend was having real trouble finding a hard copy of one of them
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Soft sci fi and YA is totally up my alley
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i had a hard copy from a mate of the first, e book the second
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and just listened to all three on audible
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	liked the narrator a fair amount
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's soft sci fi with moments of hardness
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just enough not to be like huh???
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but not too much that the other stuff feels silly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like they got shields and shit and never explain it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it takes them weeks to travel the solar system
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and they shoot missiles and railguns mostly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but mostly it is about people not ships
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	taking down the ruling class that style themselves as romans
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but are also physiologically superior to all the other classes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	woah there's a board game
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Does one need to be physiologically superior to play it?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh fuck it's got weird art for a bunch of characters
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't think i want to see these
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ruin my smokey vague mental image of the characters
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there was gonna be a movie or tv show but i think shitcanned
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Usually for the best

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	sounds nationalistic
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	indeed
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	this guy is in so many clnical trial promo materials
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i think he sold his face to big pharma

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he ALSO apparently has anal cancer and male breast cancer bc the posters keep reusing him lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	why buy new stock photo when the one you purchased last time is still good?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they should change his eye colour just so it's maybe a different guy each time
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it;s quite a piercing stare
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the total cost of this trial is 2.255 mil
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the experimental drug is $84k for 8 patients
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	damn
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the process here is pretty interesting
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I wish I quit drugs and smokes enough to do more CMAXs
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	if we screen pts for this trial and they make it almost to the trial but fail a late screening,  they have to pay us 13k for each patient that happens to
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	mr han used to work there, so did two of my coworkers. you dont wanna do cmax trials lmao the oversight is........not great and hasnt gotten better
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	facility upgraded but quality of researchers has not apparently

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	when they get to like phase 1B
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	a lot of them now allow "light smokers" too
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	which is funny bc what the hell is a light smoker
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh melb and brisbane only

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	what pisses me off about the cmax website is that they have recruiting info but dont link to their public clinial trial name or info
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and they legally have to be registered on one of our public registries
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so stop hiding ur shit

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	phase one is riskiest its like tolerability studies, aka how much can we give you before the  migraines and puking is intolerable as a side effect etc

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the lady that started on the same day i did who kinda shares my job (she does the patient stuff)
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	is just so dumb
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	im so disappointed
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i have to keep explaining things to her repeatedly and she lacks the intuition to follow instructions indepenently
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	how do people be this passive and get through life
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	idk let me ask 84 people in the office for you
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	hahaha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	oh god
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I feel that pain
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i sincerely dont understand it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	like im not a genius, so how can this be so hard for others
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I swear I spend 70% of my work day muttering "what the fuck? why?" under my breath
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	while fixing their work
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	same plus 10% actually just swearing out loud. I hate how not in control I am lately lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this is the beauty of arvo shift, jugs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	office to myself, get to swear aloud
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Seeing red while trying to computer is so counter-productive lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	latest I can do is 10-6 and i pref leaving earlier
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah those are kinda shit hours
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	splits your free time too much
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	exactly
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i dont understand how people who seem overwhelmed by a simple tool theyre required to use, arent  motivated to read the user manual? when its like 4 pages of 'quick tips to not fuck up' in huge font in a pdf with shortcuts literally everywhere straight to that manual
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i dont understand how that kind of lack of self motivation actually is compatible wtih working at this job at all
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Your expectations are way too high lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	im beginning to realize that
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Im surprised you havent come across it before, you've been lucky üòÑ
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	ive never had to get people to do things other than sign stuff before, this is a new one, etting people to READ stuff
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh man
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	We get tickets like "hey I got a popup warning that if I did this my documents would be lost. I accepted it and now my documents are lost?"
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	people wont read whats literally smacking them in the eyes, let alone manuals or god forbid google
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	im trying to meet people on their level of expectations like, theyre like 'just tell me what to click and where to upload' so im like okay this is easy i will make a screenshot walkthrough guide of exactly how you need to accomplish the one or two tasks with this tool that you actually asked me about
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and then theyre like 'so what do i do'
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	like I SHOWED U
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	bruh
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I think the problem is, there's almost a cultural taboo around criticising people, _for anything_
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	theres this one lady who isnt good with tech but shes a very sharp person, so she only asks me these really critical questions that have limited her at the point of action, like 'i uploaded my shit and i want to know if i can stack another document on top of it or nah' and meanwhile we have other the person doing her job with the 'so it wont open in internet explorer how do i access' meanwhile ive already made a chrome shortcut to the login portal on her desktop for this exact purpose
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	how is there such a discrepancy between people doing this
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i dont undrestand people
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	at all
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Some times my mind wont engage with work if I think too long and hard about how much of a farce needing to work fulltime to live is
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	maybe they live permanently in that state and only bring like 1% to work
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	maybe they're winning
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	what do I want for lunch tho
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	my eye is doing delayed focus again, finna fuck off home up in here
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	ur right i think they are winning
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	theyre mentally unburdened
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	by the drive to execute tasks properly
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	What about those of us who only bring 1% to work and still kick arse? I think we're the real winners :winky:

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Just had the most confusing meeting
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	But my colleague and boss seemed to be nodding and agreeing to do things so I guess we're on the right track?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Idk this be scary
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	do u think theyre helping

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I don't cry every day anymore so that's good
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	ive always called that feeling refridgerated thinking,  like when you refridgerate a bug and it moves real slow
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	that is gr8
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I like that in this metaphor we're supposed to be more familiar with the behavior of refrigerated bugs than the feeling of a sluggish mind
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Literally I am tho
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Bugs be like "you know how humans think slow on certain meds? Yeah, that's how it feels to move when the cunts put us in the fridge"

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Don't care for the narrator but inoffensive
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The tv series replaced the main character's initial love interest, a Nigerian girl, with a blonde hair blue eyed white girl
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Bet that went down well on twitter

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	oh OH IPDATE ON KY RAT FAMILY
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	han please don't lube up wild animals
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The neighbours cat disembowelled three of them and left them on the lawn and then some magpies came by and picked them apart
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I tried to salvage a tiny skull for art but they were too mangled and broken
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	nice!

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	kinda nice a natural pest solution, both introduced species battling to the death and then some natives get to eat the remains. It worked out nicely I‚Äôm no longer stressed about the rats
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	as long as the cats don't work out they can deliberately bait the maggies down and kill them
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I think the magpies are too smart for that. They have a perch they sit on RIGHT above the pathway the cat comes down on and they watch it come and go
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	good :)
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the pigeons on the other hand
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they‚Äôre a gamble
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I wonder if the magpies have watched me spray the cat with a hose and figured out who‚Äôs side I‚Äôm on
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they did watch me take a baby away tho and never return it

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So actual potential homelessness now, not just potential going mad
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Finding a replacement for this one will be easier since I don't really care what it is and it will be a house so pets np
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And I won't be on the lease anyway
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	*The eclipse peak is at 8:41 tonight f y i*
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Sounds like it should be someone else's problem

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	There's always a chance I'm gone first though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I don't dare be hopeful of that though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	"house so pets np" is that really the case with renting?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Pretty much yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Most detached houses don't mind cats in my experiences

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I thought landlords were all like "no pets ever" for no reason unless you're super lucky
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Nah just in units and apartments usually
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Idk i haven't been in that market really I'm talking out of my arse
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I mean obv it happens with houses too but it's a lot easier to find a pet friendly house
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Convince maddy and jack to buy a house together and take over their cat-friendly rental
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Whodat

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Azusa would never let you hold her though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	:azulaser:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	She wouldn't let me hold her if you were here

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	My brother was here for a month before shed let him touch her and even then only at dinner time
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Bro smells like kids though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'd  be scared too
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and people ask if rabbits are lame pets but put up with this from cats
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Well

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Not my problem if she don't like other people lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Rabbits are kinda lame though :P
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea Azusa ain't cuddly but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That makes the cuddles she does give way better
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	how dare u just go for the nuclear button like that schnook
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Cute but kinda autonomous
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Whenever I see a rabbit I think of baby rabbits
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Which look like little water balloons filled with blood
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Alvin follows us room to room keeping tabs like a dog in the evenings lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I don't mind rabbits but they seem high maintenance compared to cats
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he licc me
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Then there's birds
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he‚Äôs pretty low maintenance tbh if you left him alone for a week with enough hay and water he‚Äôd be fine
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Cool and super smart but fuuuuuck that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I think keeping birds is immoral
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	They're also loud and annoying aside haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think like most things it depends
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôm so so glad I have a pet that can‚Äôt make noise
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he‚Äôs so silent it‚Äôs creepy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I feel like if he could bark he would, a lot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Azusa is quiet she only really meows for dinner or yowls when she's bringing you one of her babies
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Best thing about rabbits the noise factor. Worth considering
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Jango has dementia and yowls randomly at night
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That's pretty annoying
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Awwww hahaha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	cute and sad
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'd worry about accidentally stepping on a rabbit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	He's on his last legs
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	We almost do a lot
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	hallway light permanently on for rabbit safety
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôm sry graf how old is he
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Azusa got kicked as a kitten so she doesn't walk under legs any more
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Alvins been yeeted multiple times and still dashes silently underfoot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Lmao
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So that's how you train em. Noted
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	that‚Äôs the difference he‚Äôs a smoothbrain that doesn‚Äôt learn
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Brave and stupid
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Potent combo
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	He‚Äôs dumb, but he‚Äôs tough
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Here's a question
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Would you have a rabbit if it was the size of a labrador?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://c.tenor.com/XAU-CjepflkAAAAM/nope-michael-scott.gif
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Same behaviour but more food, bigger shit etc
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	You'd have to be less tolerant of angry behaviour because it could knock you over
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	AbSOLITELY
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	we‚Äôve discussed this
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	A capybara is the perfect pet
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	We have?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ooh man capybara
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Such bros
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	oh me and mr han
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Hahahaha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	If only soft like bun
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	In depth
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The fluff would scale up to a MUCH bigger problem we worked out
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so better to be waterproof shorthair like capy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Still got snuffly nose and flops tho
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Tbh i think I'd prefer longer fur
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Only have to spend an hour in a house with a cat to feel my throat full of fur for the next 22 hours
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I want a Maine coon
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	12
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I would call her
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Big boy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Raaacist
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Big boy like the guy from outkast?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	No just big boy because big
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	That's not very weeb
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I just think calling a cat big boy because it's big is funny
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That's the level of my humour
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Coulda called it anything
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Called it big boy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	That's fair
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And Azusa is the only week cat name I got
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Weeb
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	50% is a decent rate
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	One of my hs friends had a cat called neko
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Low ass effort
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Laaaaame
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	When I got Azusa she was jealous she hadnt thought of that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I say that, but i was thinking just before "I'd probably just call it Cat"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Calling it cat is mildly amusing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Calling it cat in Japanese is not
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	We sort of had a ginger whose name was Cat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Those are the only cats named cat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The cats you sort of have
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	He may have had multiple homes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Exactly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	My grandma had a Cat too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Wait
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	DEFINITELY not a pick up cat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	No sorry it was Meow
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Barely even a pat cat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Because it meowed a lot
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Makes sense
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	When you think about it for a minute it makes sense
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I'm tryna think of weeb shit to name a cat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The only other cat I can think of is Jiji from Kiki's delivery service
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	He's black I guess
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Nobody ever talks about how Jiji out there fucking the rich cat and making babies in that movie
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Sakamoto is another black anime cat but Sakamoto sounds like the name of a salaryman
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	If I replaced Azusa I would just call the replacement Azusa 2
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Electric Boogaloo
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Not sure if jest but that's how most of our family cats were named
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Tom
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Tom 2
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Tom Again
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Tritom
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I am joking that seems really cold lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Eh. They were all loved until they got bitten by snakes or whatever I'm sure
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Tritom is different enough but the rest would realistically just be called Tom right
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea I dunno feels very uhhh
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Idk. Country cats. Probably less "called" and more just there
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I dunno like the cat is furniture
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Most of those were before my time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	There must always be a Tom
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I only remember Tritom
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Idk where they found all these tux cats
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Shoulda called one of em
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Big Boy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Hardly ever see em now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That's true ey
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Maybe out of fashion
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So less being bred
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So less being adopted too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Truly we are the aloha species of earth
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Last one was Horatio/Horry. He was a bitey boy. That was my fault for always playing rough with him
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The alpha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But also the aloha species
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Oh yea Azusa is bitey too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I think it's because Jango was too old to play with her
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So she never learned not to clamp
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Cats raised with other kittens tend to play with claws away and soft bites
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Orly
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So if i get a cat, get two
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Ya because when they get the claws out in play fighting it stops being play fighting and they get a wack
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So they learn young
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Adopting a sibling pair is super ideal
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Until one of them dies that is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And then the other one has a rough time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Shouldn't be a problem if kept indoors though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I have always regretted not taking azusa's brother too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	He was a very cuddly boy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Also we didn't need 3 cats but
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Stupid clouds

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôm now the person in charge of uploading and circulating for e certification and archiving the fax etc
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It‚Äôs a bit different on clinical trials bc the data handling is ALSO dictated by the trial sponsor and any of their data laws outside Au where their primary source data will be stored
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	So for some stuff they require faxing and no digital sending
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh man even we're almost off faxes
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	smd is so now

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	why did I start working at a normal job in 2021 to have to learn how to fax
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But at least there‚Äôs fun noises involved
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Miss the dialup screech? Just Do A Fax!

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im cutting together a video of all the submissions of game levels from last assessment
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	students sign over their ip on all school work so we can do what we want with it so im making the video without asking the students
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and the marketing guy was like well usually we ask in case they don't want to show their work
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and im like well why wouldn't they want to show it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	"well it might not be good"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	am i the asshole for thinking too bad they should have actually fucken tried then
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	lol easier to just ask and not have any complaints surely?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	don't think anybody will actually complain
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they might be annoyed that we showed their half assed level next to the cool levels from people that tried but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	to me that's a good lesson
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like, the ones who aren't great at level design but still tried are fine
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not amazing or anything but first time doing it so no big deal
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	LOL you can get your covid vaccine at the Show
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	jump the queue
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i recorded all the footage yesterday in class which was a good opportunity for everyone to see everyone else's level and one of them was like "where was mine"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so i said oh yea i only played the ones that were submitted by the deadline
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	cutting this footage is taking forever and the way davinci's cut timeline resizes to fill the entire length of the timeline it doesn't feel like im making any progress lmao
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I made a square does this count
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	> posts rectangle
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	A square can be a rectangle, but a rectangle cannot be a square
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the scope of my disappointment is beyond measurement han
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	therefore my rectangle is distantly cousins with a square and still counts
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Also if i suddenly became an accurate and reliable person then who would I be really....who??
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	in the anime about an all-female gamedev studio one of them has a pet hedgehog and it basically hates her and it's great

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	for some it's too much
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	for some it's too little
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Give the bad ones two seconds and the good ones eight seconds
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Fixed
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nah in this they must stand on their own merit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	having chopped a few up the 5 second pace aint too bad
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually i can get away with 6 seconds
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Whoa there cowboy SIX seconds
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats two 2 three second clips or 3 two second clips per game

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I rooted around in the garden this morning looking for something to feed Horsie. Came up with nothing. He's been acting and posed not quite right (imo) the last few days. I fear for his health.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Bad pet owner :(

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I put out a dead fly for him this week but idk how far he can see or if he'll even consider it food if it's already dead
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Didn't drop him on it this time after the trauma with the moth (though i think he did eat that one)
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe I do have to shove his nose in it to make him notice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Thanks jugs i'm tempted to take you up, but seems weird to come by to get bugs üòÜ
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Like they're everywhere, just grab some, except when they're surprisingly hard to find
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	you can buy 100+ at a time from petbarn but might be excessive
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	That is a lot, yeah
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	But it would be weird to buy smaller numbers
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Are they alive?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Haha I read that as "accidental poo", followed by addressing me by name

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	just getting your attention
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Makers empire is at lot 14 so the office has printer background noise
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Can't decide if it's soothing or annoying
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Flat or bumpy printer?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	They got a big boy which has stepper moves that sound like phone vibrating on wood desk
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So that's at least a bit annoying
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Bumpy then
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I can see that being annoying. One of the reasons I moved mine out of the lounge room
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea they make an app to model shit and 3d print it for schools
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I do enjoy with my own prints, recognising where it's up to based on the noise it's making
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	But hearing that constantly while trying to work would suck
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's not too bad but yea will probably have to headphones on all day haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	My bus driver is fucking fanging it right now

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I said it elsewhere today and it's mildly related so now I'm saying it here:
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Baby tortles should be called tortellini
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Fuck I'd love some tortellini rn
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Right? Best pasta format
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I had some for tea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I gotta go to work tomorrow maybe I'll find tortellini for lunch
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ew satdy work
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Just me in the office
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Reminds me I probably should have actually answered when they asked me to work satdy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You know what's weird
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	We gotta qr code sign in at Woolies
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But not on a peak hour bus
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that is pretty dumb
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Surely PT has the most shared breath of anywhere
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe they can track by ticket
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea definitely more than a Woolies lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You could only track if the person registered their metrocard
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Which you only do for auto recharge or online recharge
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Orly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea you can just buy a metrocard at a shop
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	That's a pretty big gap in the tracing network then
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You can't explain that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You know what else is weird
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I called for a pickup yet I'm standing out here in the fucken cold
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Does that mean called someone at home to get you from bus stop, or like taxi or something?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	This isn't important, I'm just curious
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Because my first thought was confusion, as is so often the case
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Help I am in turboshitpost mood
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	brother picking me up yea

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which makes sense when you think about it, that it gives up on lidar hits and gives it a few goes on the bumper
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since what it bumps into might have moved but it can tell the lidar hits haven't moved

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	should probably set up virtual barriers

No more bullshit like what I've had to put up with over the last few hours. If you can't abide by this rule, feel free to go with him."
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	now I wanna know what VH-TQF is up to that they're cagey about üòÜ
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	"SAPOL have been telling people what it does. All of Adelaide outside of the group can hear it at night and are asking questions . I‚Äôm sure it will all be public soon enough." üëÄ

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah private charter
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	supposedly currently in the employ of coppers
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Why tho
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	which would be why it's not showing up on flightradar
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I can‚Äôt even think of a good reason
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Cops can‚Äôt be smarter than me I‚Äôll figure it out
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm sure there's plenty of cop stuff that's easier from above
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the classic one is IR scanning for labs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like in every movie ever
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	yeah but don‚Äôt they have helis for that
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Way easier control
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	might cost more to operate
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and cover less ground
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	idk
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	plus I assume the police helis come with that IR stuff mounted since they have all the spotlights and stuff on them
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	hmmMMMMM
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I love a mystery thank you Schnook

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they do have their own branded copper plane
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	might be they don't want to be recognised
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Hahaha too late now
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôd buy a cheap most commonly owned already plane if I was going for incognito
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	can't remember the rego but I've seen it fly fairly low over my place a couple times about a year ago

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I should have had it open to watch
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	SA's cop plane looks cooler
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Seems like they‚Äôre homogenising the plane fleet maybe
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	wait how's the mystery over?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Nsw police has two identical cessnas in their fleet that I‚Äôve found so far so
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I just assume they‚Äôre tryna be the same
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	cops don't own this one though, just hiring
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	HMMMM
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and that doesn't explain what they're up to
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it doesn‚Äôt
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	tbh depending on how often they need it, probs cheaper to subcontract than own
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But they‚Äôre clearly going for familiarity haha maybe they have a new pilot and he missed his nsw cessna
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	My theories are getting wilder
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm gonna stick with Sig's suggestion :P
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Ok so Queensland pol uses them too

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	maybe backlit

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	just don't let the papier-m√¢ch√© go down the shower drain

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dye sublimation

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anybody use that phillips oneblade thing?
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	review me
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	It's okay? Catches your hair less than a regular electric shaver, seems to take forever to get a good even trim tho.
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I use it to trim my beard and shave the neck beard
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	does it do better than a trimmer on the neckbeard?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i am loathe to get the razor out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so i look scruffy by week's end
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yeah it does
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they got the pro with the adjustable trimmer head for the same price as the og one
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	If you got a beard to trim then for sure get the adjustable head
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I will say if you're not a daily shaver/trimmer the heads last forever
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i am definitely not
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they aint paying me enough to shave every day
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Ye it'll last like six months
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Or longer, I legit don't remember the last time I replaced mine
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	adjustable trimmer head in general seems like a no brainer why isn't it more common
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	So they can sell you the pro
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i mean in general first time i've seen it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i got a box full of fucking  different length heads from different trimmers
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Ohhhh I see
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yeah I hate the bouquet of trimmer guards they give you
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fucken hell the'd wanna last for 6 months at that price
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yeeep
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	do you use it dry?
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yeap

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what gets me is that enough people buy this fois gras for amazon to have it in their warehouse
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Nice pfp Shnoock
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that said im pretty sure fois gras is illegal to make here so they probably gotta have it stocked on hand
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im doing the 'find 5 bucks worth of something to get free shipping' game and well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	10 knockoff beyblades is tempting

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fois gras is fucked
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I guess a lot of meat is fucked, but fois gras is especially fucked
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	> Coffee, soda, energy drinks/pills and tea are popular favorites all over the world. They taste good, keep us awake and are sold virtually everywhere. But did you know that they‚Äôre all loaded with caffeine?

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	books r great from memory, don't @ me if they suck doe
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I think the main problem is I've seen expanse season 1 a bunch because it's so good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So I'm mostly noticing the differences
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Some of them are uhh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Pretty dramatic tbh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Not worse just different
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The series focuses a lot on earth v mars
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But the book is mars v belt lol
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I remember the scene ||where the dude loses his head|| being much more impactful in the book, but maybe because I read the book first
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	it true
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea actually I think that's handled better in the show
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I dunno more real and visceral
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But they never talk about him again
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	They keep bringing him up in the book which is good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And Miller like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Who the f is this guy

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Is it as good at trimming as the other stuff?
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	the blade isn't as wide as other trimmers, but does alright
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I do prefer it over a proper trimmer because it's lighter/easier to use
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	God I hate her she‚Äôs so fucking stupid

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	@Graf Eisen how did you bulk delete before you left r/adl server
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	without getting banned for TOS breaking
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	im looking for a script to nuke my history
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but not finding good stuff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I didn't
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	If it's gone I was banned
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But seems unlikely
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I just got a new account, it changes your username to "DeletedUser####"
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i dont want a new account i just want to purge like one servers history worth
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	discord is a worthless place for not having good bulk delete features
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	nah im just an idiot for using it like msn
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	lel
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You could ask the admins
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ADL admins I mean
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	They don't really have a reason to refuse
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	tbf its not yours once you post it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	yeah i dont care who owns it, i care about who can publicly crawl a years old chat and pull info
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	yes im aware this is my own problem
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but i should be able to solve it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	They absolutely do have the tools to do it with their modbots
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	hmmMM
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	They have mee6 right? its just !clear (username)
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	There's plenty of scripts out there to bulk manually delete your own messages, but poss sketchy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it looks like !clear username only does most recent 100 messages
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	no mod would gaf enough to do that 100-200 times
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	given the high volume of my jibber jabber i spew in all channels
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	do you know specifically the kinds of info you're worried about? search and destroy that and leave the rest
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	ehh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	idk all of it hahahaha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	nah, there'd be heaps that are fine
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	realistically
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	basically this is how i feel
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	>  I have 110,000 messages on a server who's culture has changed for the worse, and I don't feel as if I need my personal info out and easy to get to by the people that are now on it, and I don't physically have the time to delete 110,000 individual messages.
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the first result when i google my problem LOL
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	same dude same
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	So was there more recent excitement or is this just long lived? fill me in on the GOSS
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	no not at all
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i just had a thought

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	you could basdically tell me my life story and where i live

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha I think it's easier to avoid people than tree jizz
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and only small chance of feeling like dying from people, instead of 100%
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I've started getting hayfever the last year or two

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	> Based upon our data, evidence indicates that it is prudent to recommend the following precautions to reduce exposures in non-industrial workplaces as well as public locations such as in libraries or universities and private homes: (1) Always use the manufacturer‚Äôs supplied controls (full enclosure appears more effective at controlling UFP emissions than a cover); (2) use the printer in a well-ventilated place, and/or directly ventilate the printer; (3) maintain a distance from the printer to minimize breathing in emitted particles and choose a low-emitting printer and filament when possible; (4) if the printer nozzle jams, turn off the printer and allow it to ventilate before removing the cover; and (5) utilize the industrial hygiene hierarchy of controls to mitigate exposures (from most to least preferable): engineering > administrative > protective equipment (e.g., respirators).
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I do use all the manufacturer's supplied controls

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Admiral Nelson
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Tastes better and cheaper
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Or at least it did two years ago

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Isn‚Äôt an admiral higher ranked than a captain
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Like admiral commands a fleet and captain commands a ship right
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Wrong I think
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	help
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	graf use ur navy knowledge
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	out of stock hmmm
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but yes generally
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	commanders can also command ships
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	oh I forgot about them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and admirals command the flagship
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Commanders are for space
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so admirals lead and make choices or nah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	admirals are the equivalent to generals yea
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	NICE
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so basically
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Admiral Nelson is superior
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Alex and I used to ask each other for an Admiral and Dry back in the day
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so many jokes about admiral Nelson
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Commanders in the US navy can command frigates and destroyers and submarines
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think most sub "captains" are commanders
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	do people even use admiral
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Still
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Is it a retired term
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Learned that from Star Trek
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	admiral is still a rank yes
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	nice
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	including the best rank
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Rear Admiral
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Do they get amazing outfits
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't think there's a specific uniform but they do get stars
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oh you bet I‚Äôm going here
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniforms_of_the_Royal_Navy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well ive been talking about US navy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	royal navy has different ranks
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Tailcoat option :pepeaaaaaaagh:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the best thing about royal navy ranks is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well actually there's two things
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	one is the Commodore rank
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	being a Commodore would be cool
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yeah before the car
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	what‚Äôs the power
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It has
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the other is that Commander used to be called
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Commodores are between captains and rear admirals i dunno really what they do
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	US navy skips it entirely
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Whyyyy
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Why do they exist
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i assume its the first rank you can command more than one shipo
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	my guess would be commodore is still in the fleet by design wheras admirals can spend time ashore doing boring shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh the US navy replaced commodore with Rear Admiral (lower half) which is the rank before Rear Admiral
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that's kind of funny i guess
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I don‚Äôt get any of it but lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The military has a weird amount of traditional fluff in it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	> Tradition is the crown of the tyrant. I eye all the Golds in their badges and Sigils and standards, all worn to legitimize corrupt reign, and to alienate the people. Make them feel they watch a species beyond their comprehension.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its a commentary on totalitarianism which is almost directly relevant to military
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	No totalitarianism without enforcers
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Nice quote
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	@Jugsy i member
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i member but i do not continue
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fucking hell
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	streetview of the new place is like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	literally fields
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	diggers breaking ground
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i shit you not
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	morning
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	you got a place?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	or fam place?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	latter
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	even further away
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ah right
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its 20 minutes walk away from where i am now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which is where the closest bus stop is
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	so it's near bus stop?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its further away
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh, damn
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	15 minutes walk as opposed to like 3
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	well, more reason to fly the coop I guess
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if there was a through path through the block it would be probably 5-7 minutes walk
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but fuck pedestrians
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah that's annoying hey
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	for the sake of 2m lane
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	errybody have to go the long way
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	theres a big fuckoff empty field that i guess someone owns and didn't sell
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if that wasn't there there'd be a through road i reckon
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but also they can fit another pokey house where even a pedestrian path would go so probably not
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yep
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	really lightly complained about the walk
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	more just mentioned it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and my brother was like get a car then
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it really do be like that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	now im usually pretty light on the c bomb
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but the only reasonable response to that was
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	get fucked cunt
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	more like get own place cunt
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	cunt
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	harder to do
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	even further away from the train station too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but yeah, hard for everyone to be near PT
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not that it was really walking distance anyway
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	new development so construction noise will be all day
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not feeling it tbh
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	1. Get car

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and I don't wanna spend an hour a day with someone I'm not paid to be polite to :P
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that whole area west of the expressway is a PT deadzone
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	bus runs two street over from me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i mean obv there's buses but they don't count
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	on two different streets
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but it probs takes 1hr+ to city
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	you wanna go west for seaford line if PT south I think
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	eh? the seaford line is basically on the coast
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so you don't really have a choice
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that is west, yes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	far south anyway, bedford park/edwardstown there are more options
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and more rail
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yup
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	give it another 6 months and I'll know a nice rental in mitchell park that allows pets, close to train
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	though being a small house, probs still spenny
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if im still looking in 6 months ill be an alcoholic

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	such a fucking pain in the arse, man
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I really hope it works out for you soon

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	assuming they shared :P
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	at least let me have my imaginary kind rich parents

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the only places I ever saw (in admittedly a short time a long while ago) were real dumps

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or maybe it made sense in the 60s i dunno
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not so much
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	at least cover it up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	probably not gonna fall on your head
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hang a load bearing picture
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I only have a problem with cracks if they're in a place I have to pay to repair
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably not going to get run over if i walk in the middle of a freeway doesn't mean i'll take the risk
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think there's a disparity in probability there, but it's obviously your choice
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the stupid tiny windows though :(
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well you're really visible in the middle of a freeway so it's actually pretty safe assuming it aint the middle of the night and/or raining
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	check out the backyard on this bitch
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	bigger than the one this house has
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	man my whole car's really visible, people still wanna drive into that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	dat hammock
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	will you use an outside?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no also no pets
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i would probably not apply for it even if it was pet friendly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	better off going to someone who will use it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's a nice way of thinking about it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I was more thinking about having to mow a lawn you don't use
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's that too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lots of effort
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	now this is ballsy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	my uncle lived in a place like this when i was a kid and i was traumatised by these steps because the toilet is upstairs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	what were they thinking?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can *see through* the steps
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fucking madness
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh yeah
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not a huge fan of that, but not so bad when you're taller
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	spiral stairs are especially fucked
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this whole thing is held up by a single pole!
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	half of each step is so narrow that it's unusable!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea architect wank those
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	outside of castle towers i guess
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	made for tiny spaces
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	used unnecessarily in houses
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well i applied for treehouse
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	pretty likely i get bounced for pet though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yessss
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I just read about hatsune miku in a context that actually fascinated me
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	And now I want to know more
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I want to witness the origin
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	:miku:
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	:miku:
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I suspect there's someone here who could tell you more
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it's me
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Miku *is* the origin
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the big bang was her fault
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	What's that
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The concept of vocaloids
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Did it go into the Is Hatsune Miku a Vocaloid? question
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	No, it started on the assumption she is? But I don‚Äôt understand the tech and it‚Äôs coool
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's too high level of a discussion I guess
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Miku's latest version is not compatible with the Vocaloid software
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Crypton has their own synthesis software now totally separate from Vocaloid
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So the question is, does that mean Miku (and soon the other crypton vocaloids - which, largely, are all the popular ones) is not a Vocaloid?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You'll never hear crypton describing Miku as a Vocaloid and honestly you never did so I think the community has settled in "Vocaloid is a generic trademark"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I sleep
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	DOUBLE SLEEP ACTIVATED

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	tiny one!
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I have one too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	huge one
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I was thinking about dice last night
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and how if I'm spending all this money on having hundreds of beautiful dice I hardly use, I should display them
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Y. ES
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm thinking a wall display of perspex boxes maybe
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like some of the cool hotwheels do
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but I'm open to other ideas
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That would be neat af plus u can handle them
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	glass top coffee table would be cool but ain't got use or space for a coffee table
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah I'd need to be able to take it down and take them out easily
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	swap 'em around for different patterns n stuff
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	What about those Perspex makeup drawers completely clear
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like this?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ooh this one has mirrored back
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	gonna need big though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	If you do that you should put them all into one die wide containers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Maximum vertical viewage
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	uuughhhh that sounds painful to work with
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	though you're right, that would look cool
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I was thinking one set per box
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	If you're gonna dedicated that much space you gotta display them more interestingly I think
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I think part of the appeal of dice is the chaos
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	this is true
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but your idea intrigues me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Not mixing them up but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Not caring about individual order or placement
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	when you say "one die wide containers", do you mean on die per section, or just tall sections full of dice like a coin dispenser?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	a huge one of these with one die in each hole
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and a real pain to get them out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea a stack
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Like you can get some poly dice sets in
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I wanna say chessex does em like that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh yeah like the test tubes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Ya
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	hmm
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Although square container would look better imo
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah reflections
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	On a shelf anyway
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I was thinking of hanging them on the wall under the air con that I used to demonstratte my white walls the other day
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	If you want to get classy/spenny U could put em in one of these https://www.google.com/search?q=type+drawer&client=ms-android-samsung-gs-rev1&prmd=sivn&sxsrf=ALeKk02rKuA9PpD_FIT7-PZlh_CC5JfxOg:1622857324661&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwicz-3Srv_wAhX9zjgGHR2eBL0Q_AUoAnoECAIQAg&biw=384&bih=718
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'm not entirely against spenny
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Already been spenny
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Store em in a big dice
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	A big see through one
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	This one already has rocc https://images.app.goo.gl/kiTxZ51PnsyFTp7q7
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	If you didn't care about mixing them up a big container would look cool
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the wooden shelves look beautiful, but I'm inclined to stick to minimal not-dice features, so entirely clear if I can
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I do care about mixing them up, yeah
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	https://images.app.goo.gl/nXxSHeNni25EhiJp9
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	big container would be hella easy though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ha cute
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Nice
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	bigger!
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Imagine rocking up with this thing https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B082LQ1H7Q/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_TCRCHQVFTARHKMRWMS9B
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Tactical dice container
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha as if my D&D bag isn't bulky enough as it is
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	all those metal dice
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	poor table
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I guess if you're carrying that beast, you have a rolling tray
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ha I just noticed the search term on your wooden box
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I know where to find some of those
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Really üëÄüëÄüëÄ
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I put my cosmic encounter into a metal briefcase
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I love them
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	well, like 16 years ago
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	That is less useful
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	there was a chest of fonts in the lobby at croydon tafe
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	probs still there
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they might notice you taking it
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Fun fact those drawers are where the terms "uppercase" and "lowercase" come from
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sorry, your what?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	all sorts of legacy typography terms we still use
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think my favourite is leading
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	plus all the expansions
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ooh, pretty
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they don't all fit in the core box which is oversized but not oversized enough
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it was probably big enough for all the re-released expansions but not for the new one
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	now it's srs bsns box
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea with latches and everything
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	man i really need to get a cosmic encounter night going again
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	love the shit out of that game
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I don't know it. Is it complex?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	simple rules but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	each alien has it's own set of rules
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	or perhaps, what popular game is it on par with, complexity-wise
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that can and will break the core game rules
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	for example one alien has the power to turn wins into losses and vice versa
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well, *has* to do that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so you have to totally change strategy when dealing with that player
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't play enough board games to draw a comparison
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ok :)
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	complexity wise maybe oneshot babby's first dnd
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	where you gotta remember what you can do but the DM is ignoring a bunch of shit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	interesting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's a very specific turn phase order that you need to follow and new players can get caught up with it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but my mum learned to play it in 2 games and she fucken gives up on anything that's too hard
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i mean she doesn't want to play it again because she lost and she's a sore loser but that's an aside
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha boo
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Muuuum
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	can you fuck people over deliberately?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	absolutely, it's almost the point
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	because that's my style
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I don't care about winning, I just want to ruin someone else's day
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can definitely play that game
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	some of the alien powers are like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i can just take one of your ships
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	why?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because i can fuck you
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	one of them is literally "i win on turn two if you don't fuck my shit up"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they break the game but the game is designed to be broken by them so it works pretty well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if someone has an "op" alien everyone gangs up on them so it's self-balancing in a way
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	eat the rich
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the rules i tend to play with have your alien a secret until you use it's power
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which is so much fun
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because someone will just be quietly playing not using their power
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and you're thinking what's the motherfucker gonna do
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then you're about to win the game and they're like ok i reveal myself as the Fusion, your planet explodes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	so experienced players have a strong advantage?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	for the first couple of games yeah but the skill ceiling is very low
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its just abouit knowing the structure of the game and when and where your alien powers are most useful
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's over 200 aliens with all the expansions
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sounds like it'd be over my head, but still fun
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if you can dnd you can play this
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like i said the complexity comes from the aliens
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which are usually random
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dnd players are good cosmic encounter players usually too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	nice
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's more fun if you act like your alien
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'd offer to host a game night, but you're not gonna travel out to me are ya?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so if you're playing the sun blocking insect armada you don't make alliances you just fuck shit up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I have a nice big table
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeah its a bit far for me
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	geolocked :(
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	maybe after i move
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i do have the tabletop sim official dlc for it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it was necessary in my proselytizing of the game
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	ehhh it's not the same
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	for sure
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i used to host games in the gameplus board room on grenfell
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably im not supposed to do that any more since im not a tenant but i do work for the company that owns gameplus soooooo ü§î
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	seems reasonable
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Cosmic encounter sounds so great
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	a game to test the ties that bind #hobbies
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I've already played my hand
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	take it or leave it üòÜ
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im thinkin about buying necromunda

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	will be weeks until we play again but hopefully find it then lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	might just cheat tbh we only needed 1 core
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it'll grow in that time :P
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	exactly

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no swamps around
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we will definitely die
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we'll just cheat for the one core and be on our merry way
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if we were gonna play more than once every few weeks it would be a different matter but we already spent like 2 hours looking for a new tomb
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	rather stick to the fun stuff
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	nothing wrong with that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	as far as i understand it it's the only thing blocking progression so pretty annoying
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we tried to go to a distant island on the raft and then like 1/3rd the way there the raft switched it's model to the damaged version so we're like uhhh maybe not
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just seems to randomly take damage
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	:(
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway bedtime
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	This is your fault @MrSchnookums
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	You're gonna feel silly about this when you find the plentiful source of cores
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Also yeah all the boats take damage on ocean, you're not meant to raft that much
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Sounds like you did get stiffed on crypt cores tho, you should ez have enough for one kiln and one smelter
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	You could just world hop rather than cheat too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I can guarantee you I won't feel silly lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Aont playing the game to run around looking for needles in haystacks

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	We're so stop starty with it.. I defs wanna finish but those updates would help motivation if they ever come
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they got an ad in the pre show for this garbage ar wrist game thing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	who the fuck wanna be pointing their phone at their wrist

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well its a pub mirror so it's exactly that

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the limited quantity is a meme
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	390
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	39 is miku's number

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I just don‚Äôt want to clean
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they‚Äôre so bad at reorganising it‚Äôll be like another 3 to 6 weeks before they reschedule
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Am I this lazy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that's pretty big brain
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it would work no questions asked but do I really want to take advantage of this for my own sake
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	inb4 they go "ok just send us some photos then"
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôd prefer that I still have tons I didn‚Äôt send of last time I took photos I can use some of those

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	your people seem chill though, I'm sure there's not much needs doing to be satisfactory
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	There isn‚Äôt actually much to do at all except vacuum and do the oven
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But the garden out back

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i didn't watch the US one
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	only the pre show to see if it was worth watching

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	chat is gross as usual
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	an actual physical miku expo would have lots of cringey weebs but still better than twitch chat
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Would it smell better doe
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I saw MikuExpo trending so thought to ask

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	she got a different outfit every song
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	usually the outfits are designed for the MV so it could be any random person's design

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	spiderhan
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	miku was hype
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	shame they can't do that stuff with the physical concerts
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they used a lot of cool VFX which is impossible with the holograph tech
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	can't wait for AR eyeballs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there was a bit where they just fucken transported miku into another dimension
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also the audio sync was maybe 100ms out which made it look like the band was miming lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the true live experience
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wish this was on last night

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im making a powerpoint for class tomorrow
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	delet broken
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the slice preceding that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i always ask the class if they know what something means first
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this time i got a slide for it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	how to debug:
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	‚ñ´Ô∏è At least fucking glance at the error
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yes i covered that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they should be getting me to do curriculum dev
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I have learnt, in recent years, that not everyone can just scan for keywords
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it helped me come to terms with why nobody can fix their own shit at work
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't believe that's true, i think a lot of people just don't practice solving their own problems enough to get good at it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like when it's a foreign language like c# fair enough but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think it's just a lack of initiative which can definitely be a trait of people and not just them being lazy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah for sure practice would help
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and the initiative thing, I agree
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	people decide they can't do things, so don't try
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but I don't remember learning this skill, just doing it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I guess it translates through lots of things
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think for alpha humans like you and me we had the stubbornness to smash through it on our own early on
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i rather solve things on my own than ask for help
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i do know when enough is enough
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's page 5 of google
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ok class prepped time for slemp
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well after i watch an ep of wire to climb down from this miku energy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I don't like to ask for help until I have a really specific question
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and a list of things you already tried üìë
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	oh yeah that too!
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	"this thing is breaking because this reason. If I make this change, will it break any of the other shit I don't know about?"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Waking up in the morning to a three year old screaming because he's getting told off why the fuck people have kids tho

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	One of my bosses gave me a connect for one though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	If I get that one my faith in democracy will be shattered

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	did u remind them to ask Why? a problem is happening too also good presentation learned a lot thanks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Not specifically but you find out why a bug exists by finding the bug
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The why was that bug created in the first case isn't really very interesting because it's usually lack of experience, ineptitude or 4pm

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It goes like pyon pyon mata pyon pyon sawatte
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Pyon is the onomatopoeia for bunny jumping
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://youtu.be/--41OGPMurU I'm not quite sure what it's about something about fake unrequited love or something. Celebrity culture maybe
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	The English subtitles suggest it is about fucking
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Haha there's like one line about that
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Two lines!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It could be about booty call relationships I guess
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But I think the mating line is just talking about how rabbits don't do shit but eat and mate
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	In any case it's a banger
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Also that shitty wrist ar thing I mentioned is now a meme

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ahha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Character sheets on phones
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://c.tenor.com/Yprehqh-5hQAAAAM/dry-heave-throw-up.gif
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I've literally never filled out a paper character sheet
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You're missing out
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Paper is so convenient but I did like the online experience
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Rubbing out your xp and making it higher
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	With multiple monitors hehe
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Adding a cool new toy to your inventory
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Physically writing out your ho going longer
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's a lot more intimate
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But yea online loses a lot of that intimacy besides character sheets even though it's still heaps of fun
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And usually more viable
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Avcon fucking up the indie games room this year
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Apparently they only invited people that emailed them about it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But most of us were waiting for them to get their shit together and announce it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So stupid
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And now it's so close to avcon that most people won't exhibit even if they do open applications
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Rip. Who's running avcon these days?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Fuck if I know
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Seems to change every year
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Indie games room is not run by the avcon committee either afaik
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But the igr organiser literally changes every year
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Anyway I'm annoyed because I was gonna take defender so I had a good deadline
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But I gave up like 2 months ago when it was radio silence
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Lameo
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Sucks
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe you could tell them what you told us in an effort to get them to not fuck it up next year
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Reddit broken, other stuff too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So I hear

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	eventually wearing down the edges of ur sanity
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	gradually burrowing into the deep recesses of ur mind
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	slowly, but surely, you become....your own writhing parade of errors
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	also did my photo of the rainbow i saw at the train station upload

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	its kinda like, fuck you valve also
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that will cost more than 1900 bucks hahaha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	This guy "just" getting a gpu
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but yea the quest 2 is really a great buy too

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the high hz of the index is better for your racing tho
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	quest2 will be nice enough for me im not a quality stickler
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I like the premise
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not that you can vr in F1 but
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Finding a gpu though

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	I‚Äôve heard positive things about Quest 2 from a old coworker.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I like it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	quest 2 is ridiculously good for the price
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	With little other experience to compare to, i reckon it's pretty good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like the index is over 1000 bucks more but it maybe offers a couple hundred bucks worth of extra oomph
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	im playing f1 on a 60hz tv at the moment fwiw, quest2 will be nice upgrade
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	facebook the real loss leader

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if you're running f1 in vr it will probably not end up being 90hz since there's no native vr support
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but you could play it on a big ass virtual tv at 90hz easily

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Mr han wants to show off his pedal he built

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	thats cool af
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	we came to the agreement we‚Äôre never gonna have a dining room and he can have a second office for electronics
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Electronics productivity has increased now lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	man loves to build

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	mr han has built 3
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	His most recent was a soldano clone
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Saved himself like $4k lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Built it for $200
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Sounds beautiful too
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	wowly shit
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	He‚Äôs never built amps before that, he just bought kits and joined forums it‚Äôs easy to do on your own if you can do basic research etc
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah looks pretty achievable
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	will 100% injure myself enroute but thats just how i make üòé
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so far he hasn‚Äôt electrocuted himself not even a little shock
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	And he‚Äôs kinda haphazard
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	So there‚Äôs that
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	if i dont solder myself a little bit, i havent soldered
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Ohhh easy peasy just make sure you buy an iron with a LIGHT ON THE END and a magnifier
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	you will need it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	easy to learn get a practice board first don‚Äôt learn on your first build if possible
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	nah I have many equipments already
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I still do the fiddly bits for him bc I have steadier hands
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	drones bruh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oh yeah I forgot about that
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	my b lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	haha no sweat I havent done anything or gone to an event in months so me too almost
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	soldering is the easy bit, theres a bit of math involved that‚Äôs the only real tricky part
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh damn I was hoping for basically paint by numbers on a PCB
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it basically is BUT some parts are hard to get so you have to substitute
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and that‚Äôs the math bit
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Mainly pedals but the soldano clone did require a couple of substitutions
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ahhh right. yeah I guess individual parts would be even cheaper than whole kits hey
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you know they invented watch batteries for this exact reason right
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I have several watches but don‚Äôt wear them idk man stop touching my wrists I need those free for hair ties and scritncjies

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and it only has a hanger bar no actual usable space in it lmao

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	rumour is apple is gonna do some ar glasses soon
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Couldn‚Äôt they make it QR code sensitive and do the display the same way
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Google lacks innovators smh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	look forward to that because apple usually don't release something garbage
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I hate to agree but I love my iPhone lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they haven't done anything interesting with iphones since
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	iphone
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	smh compared to samsung which was my ride or die for years
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	this things surprisingly better
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but stuff like earpods and air tags
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	both things that existed for years
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but apple was like ok here they are but like good
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I figured out ‚Äúgestures‚Äù and now it‚Äôs stupidly fast to use
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	is one of the "gestures" air quotes?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	yeah to be fair I bought fake earpods because that‚Äôs not apple worth lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ar glasses have been around for a while but they're a bit garbage
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I think I can make up my own maybe I‚Äôll add one
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so if apple is entering the market they found a way to make them fashionable
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they better be anti fog bc masks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea for 200 bucks more they will be
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôll wait ten years and buy a refurbished pair for $39 on gumtree

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	genuinely how I do it when customers say shit like "quince"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess the thing is miku has no official colour because her hair changes slightly every version
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and there's a thousand designs made for different songs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah I looked first for official, then saw there wasn't one
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	United Colours of Miku
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	v1 miku was fairly green

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then v4 miku went more blue

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	my gear s3 is barely making a day now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it seems like wearOS still blows chunks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh right they announced samsung is going to unfuck wearos
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so there's no point buying a new watch until the new wearos comes out :blobangrypuff:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fuck it ill just buy this https://casiowatches.com.au/products/dbc32-1
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	lots of current models have promised wearos 3 compatibility
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	but if you're on less than 1gb ram an update might be sensible anyway
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i don't trust them promising shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im unironically tempted just to get a casio
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not the calculator but the f91 or something similar
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that classic everyone's got one casio digital
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I don't think I've ever had a digital
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	always had the ol handsnface

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and it fell to the ground and broke
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i also got beat up
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all in all it was a bad day

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sounds like a bad time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	kyles always talk about getting into fights
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	often with the drywall

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it is ever so slightly larger
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but the built in has fucking swinging doors
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so usable space is considerably smaller
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fuckign discord

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably cheaper
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	much, probs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i measured the space and one of my measurements is obviously wrong
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not one that matters but it's real :huh:
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sounds like it's time for a new measuring tape
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is vaguely right
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	doors on the left wall up top
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the thin line is where the doors of the BIR foul, not an actual wall
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and yes the BIR is that deep
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fucking pathetic
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	deep enough for hangers?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea just lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it has a hanger bar

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but what i got now is exactly a lack table deep
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so 55cm vs 47
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which doesn't seem like much but it LOOKS like much
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also the doors fouling more space than there is BIR space is just fucking laughable lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all this aside
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the street number is 39

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea taking off the doors is an option ive considered
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	have to ask landlord tho

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	though doing it multiple times you might risk stripping the holes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	anyway, was jokin

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	without working it out, I'd expect about twice as much material, since no hexes share sides anymore
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Oh I was imagining the hexes as their own individual "boxes"
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Ye more material

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not huuugely bigger - 832mm wide instead of 640mm wide, same height
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	the weight might be prohibitive with all that extra material

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i just had a really weird moment
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	where i had forgotten i was in the new place
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and everything just felt really off
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess because the frame of reference of my PC against a wall with bookcase to the left hasn't changed
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and in the periphery my piano could be mistaken for the window with the blind mostly down
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	in any case it was like a weird sense of vertigo for a moment
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	brain fart
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I just got to pat a dog at work, day made
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	guy i know just announced this morning that his 90s reverential harrier sim is being published by micropose and that is very hype so if you're keen on this give it a wishlist https://store.steampowered.com/app/1347550/Tiny_Combat_Arena/
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Yes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can find an old prototype on itch if you google the name

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if you wanna get an idea of the style
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	although it's changed a lot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	still sort of sits between sim-lite and full on sim
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	v cool
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	he is an old freelancer modder which is how i know him

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not even a bundle deal smh
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I was looking at Microprose catalogue and was really confused by `Sid Meiers Pirates! - 1987`
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I now realise that game was tooootally overhauled at some point and thats what I played
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea you're thinking of Sid Meier's Pirates! (2004)
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	little upgrade lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	new micropose isn't actually the same micropose
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	some random fan from the defence industry bought it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the brand that is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but he's been throwing money at indies making combat sims so all the more power to him
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	cute
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I should give moo3 more of a go i loved moo2
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	omg u reminded me of when they accidentially put the full version of moo3 instead of the demo on the demo disc for PC PowerPlay magazine, and this was before it was even released
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I got this
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the general consensus is moo2 was the last time moo was good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or at the very least the peak of the series
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I honestly miss PC powerplay's glory days haha
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	right?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	slobbering all over the beast every month. Would be funny to look back on those specs now hehe
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think i threw it out last move but i kept one demo disc
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that had a mod for tibsun
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because i couldn't find it online anywhere
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	a wiser me would have archived that disc
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	some of the mods were toptier, they also like doubled the playercount of Desert Combat by putting it on a disc once lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	holy shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i was looking for a different older tweet and
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this tweet was a video showing ninty asking people to link their favourite nintendo music
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but all the links in the replies were dead
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because ninty DMCAd them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then apparently they DMCAd the video lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	wow
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh hey there's a moo4 (just called moo)

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i've heard that one is just ok but makes you wanna just play moo2
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Yep reviews agree, sounds like new players love it, moo2 nostalgists get.... that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	average moo2 fan
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	average endless space enjoyer
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	when you clone yourself into an entire civilisation
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	haha

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i set up this site file so whenever someone external uploads to it, it pushes the document to me in a notification email
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but there is this one person
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	who screenshots their upload
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and sends me copies every single time
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they must have been burned before lmao because no matter how much i reassure them i am indeed getting their documents and the audit trail records it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they just wont stop lol

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It had not saved
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So fuck that last 15 minutes work I guess

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Nah it was opened in place
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And save as just isn't a thing I do with unity workflow

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Toilet don't refill it's cistern
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Filling it back up from the tap every time I piss
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	can you open the cistern
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Apparently that don't rate as emergency by new landlord
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yes that's how I'm refilling it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	bucket flushing would probs be easier than normal flushing and refilling?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That requires finding a bucket
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	TRUE
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Only reason we can refill is because the uhh
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	toilets are hell user serviceable though, there's probably just a joint stuck somewhere stopping the float dropping
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	What do you call those things you stick on the tap to wash children
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Was in the bathroom box

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	can you see the float in there and is it floating
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea I had a look and even when you actuate the mechanism manually it don't fill
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	ok my real dream is to be able to breathe underwater
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So I think there's something wrong on the valve end

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	since I had to clear out my lounge room for visitors
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	then I thought my eyes hurt too much, not today
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Oh yea these finally showed up
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Profile is wack obviously but it's a good colour combo
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	mm nice combo
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	bit high
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea SA caps next to oem is no good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But I do like how they feel
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Tempted to order a keyboard set of SA caps but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Seems kinda like effort to work it out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Since all wonky sized keys
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Because 65%
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	sounds annoying
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It makes me tempted just to go back up to tkl just to make buying caps easier lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Maybe one of those compact tkls
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Oh never mind the ones I'm thinking of are compact 100%
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	whats an SA cap
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Curvy

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	In the vertical axis
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I was gonna be a smartarse and post a picture of a cap with SA Great on, but they don't exist
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You can also get DSA which are curvy on both axes so you get a bowl
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	I get sore hand so easily from WASD
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	no matter where i place it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Nevermind I'm wrong
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	DSA are low profile SA
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I guess the ones I was looking at just have more bowl action
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	SA caps are bowl-y but these ones are really subtle
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't really get those
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i like cool 3d resin art pieces

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i have exactly 0 desire to put em on my keyboard

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	file management and save/loading its just so fucking dull

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	overtime?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	imagine working somewhere that pays OT instead of toil
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats the dream
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	salaries are bunk
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	if I'm coming in on saturday (and I'm not), you better gimme that double time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	salaries are great, salaries with toil and not ot are bunk
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if you have a salary without one or the other you're being taken advantage of
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and maybe illegal?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or some other system like flex i dunno
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think flex is just toil by another name
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	pretty sure every salary worker at my job are being hugely taken advantage of
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they seem to stay longer than standard hours frequently, and not take as much time off to make it up, because management guilts them or some bullshit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea thats pretty common
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you do need to stand up for yourself
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like, go home, the work will still be there in the morning
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and if it piles up too much, there needs to be more staff
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but if people keep doing extra, they have no reason to hire more
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	OT is the right solution if people are regularly there late because there's work need doing
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but money!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all toil does is waste more time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since its just people... not working
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but yes its cheaper to pay OT (or not) than it is to hire new people
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and less work for management
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hence why crunch culture exists
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i should say im not actually on the side of management here they should just hire more people
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just saying why they won't haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	The OT thing is interesting. My dept is all wage, and they tend to staff us at levels that can only just keep up during quiet periods, then push a billion OT for 10 months of the year
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	there's no way it's more economical to give 6 people double time for working weekends almost all of the time than to employ another person at normal rates
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	when you factor in training and ongoing employee costs it often is
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it made sense when we were prtty much wine only, so busy period was only a few months a year
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's a short term solution ofc
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the smart thing to do would be to take on new hires when it's quiet and train them up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yep!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i imagine there isn't a lot of growth in that sector
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	we were supposed to be getting at least one new skilled worker and a couple apprentices at the start of the year when it was quiet
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they "couldn't find" a skilled operator, and only just got the two apprentices
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the boss needed a new rim for his lambo
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	meanwhile, we've lost 2 skilled workers in the last month
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	clearly they're not paying enough to compete with other companies
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Pay rate must not be enough if they can't find skilled workers
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	one of them asked for some concessions with timing for family reasons, they told him a flat out "no" with no negotiation, so he fucked off to somewhere that pays more and was flexible
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Good on him.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	happens to be the same place as one top-tier skilled guy who left last year for fewer hours and more pay
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Oh damn
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	just waiting for our halfway between IT and my job guy, who built all my dept's systems, to leave
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	that'll be fucked
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	funnily enough if you treat your workers like shit you will struggle to find workers lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think I'm next in line for managing that shit if he goes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it sounds like it's a shit place to work, but I don't think it really is if you're willing to stand up for yourself
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but so many people are easily bullied, so work does just that, because they can

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I hate it when people think a good work ethic means unpaid overtime, burning yourself out, getting stepped all over
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like, where are these gregs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	and how can I stay away

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	every yearly review, I get told all is good, but I don't do enough overtime, and I go "ok" like acknowledge your complaint, but I'm not going to change that
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Lol, if there's always overtime that's not enough staff right
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im doing OT right now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	in my experience, greg likes beer, but greg *loves* wine
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Someone decide for me, valheim or f1
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its casual employment so it's not really OT

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I don‚Äôt know why
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Me looking for ants at the dog park
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I'm worried someone's gonna think I'm baiting, pulling little vials out my pocket and walking off in to the corner lol

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	"oh *under breath* another crazy"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nah im gonna get bolt cutters since it's padlocks 100% of the time and they're worthless once the key is gone anyway
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	are you even allowed to take rocks from nat parks?
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yeah if you have a fossicking license and aren‚Äôt selling them

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	totally
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	bump keys are kind of brute force, right?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	usually i can drill out the pins but i dunno this one might have a ball bearing in it or something
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Why pick a lock when you can make c4 in ur shed

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Uhhh i don't think so
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think I started on frowny but before I got far someone else already did it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Lol the lights at lot 14 fade when they motion sensor times out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But they fade out slowly enough that I had a little mini panic like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Fuck am I going blind
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe you are
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Apparently my furious programming wasn't enough to trip the sensor I had to do the arm flail
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Better than being totally out of its view
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Had to scoot into the middle of the room every half hour in my last office
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Hahaha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The worst is when you're in the toilet just trying to get away
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And it's like fuck you total darkness
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And then the stall walls are in the way
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Haven't had that happen, but I'd be prepared for it from just never turning lights on at home
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Can't poo in the dark
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	What if a spider crawls on me
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	If you can't feel it, no problem
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Yea but in the light I'd see it coming
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And I can fuck that mfers shit up with a well timed air freshener can to the thorax
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Do spiders have thoraxes
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Haha classic
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	At least shouldn't be an issue at work, inhospitable to life place that it tends to be
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That is true
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Today I went and did my datacentre induction at YourDC, and everywhere they have automatic lights as you walk in to rooms.  Except the toilet.  Which I didnt realise and just stood in there flailing for 30 seconds
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That's the one place everywhere has motion sensors on
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I didnt tell my inductor about it lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It annoys me that foot opening doors aren't standard by now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	For not residential toilets
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	You don't kick doors open?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Hard to kick it open when you're inside and it opens inside
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Kick harder!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Wash your hands and then immediately lay hands on a thing heaps of grotty fucks who didn't wash their hands have touched
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Im tall enough to open all our office doors with my knee, its great
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So I always sanitise after leaving the toilet
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	but yeah coming out of the toilet you need to pinky-clench the handle of filth
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Which is easier these days to be fair
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh and Im also tall enough to ding our swipe card thing with my card still in my pocket if my hands are full. But the receptionist said it looks like Im thrusting the doors :frownfritz:
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Fist-open doors if they're levers rather than knobs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Jugs that's all the more reason to
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You don't like that job right? Solid eye contact while you do it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	You'll be out in hours
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	3!!!! obviously. man im braindead

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	I remember always looking at the display model for the upgraded wing at the childrens hospital, always eyeing it.
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Omg in my technics class (shop/woodworking) there was a scale model of a hotel in the back I would obsess over

212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	and I still assume that was screening to reduce the chances of bigoted cops getting through

212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	no way it wasnt to weed out the prejudice as we had heaps of women in the intake and a few other minorities

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no just fleece on its own is not a good windbreaker lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Lol when I heard a scream one morning and it turned out mr han dragged his robe belt through the toilet water before flushing accidentally
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Maybe I've just never had a good windbreaker
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Its like that thing, you dont look at 4k, you never want 4k
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Now that ive experienced moderately good noise cancelling headphones I am ruined
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	noise cancelling is nice but i haven't really been missing it on my new cans
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	good environment lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea a bus is a great listening environment
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	perfect acoustics
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no background noise
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	maybe if our heater didn‚Äôt sound like a Diesel engine I wouldn‚Äôt notice it as much but that things loud
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea if you have constant background noise they are great
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	im amazed it can perfectly cancel the rumble, like perfectly. HOW
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	plays same frequency back to cancel it out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's actually pretty simple, it just inverts the noise it picks up from the mics
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	magic
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can extract vocals out of music by doing the same thing if you have the instrumental
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	I only have PNC and I like it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	assuming it's the same mix
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	but my cans at home are open back
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	ANC would be a whole other world
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it falls apart when the background noise changes a lot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	a bus is actually a great example, the changing of the bus engine as it hits corners and stuff ends up turning into a dramatic change in pressure in the cups as the ANC tries to keep up
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since in most cases ANC is covering up noises in the low-mid ranges
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Ive never had issues on buses
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	The noticable one for me is sudden cackles/yells really nearby
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	probs depends on the quality of ANC
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	and the cup/iem seal
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	my headphones have been real workhorses, dropped a couple of times, travelled around the world
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	the noise passthrough on mine is helpful sometimes and othertimes destroys my ears

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it is, as expected, a lot
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	my colleague did wear it as a cape for a bit lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	haha excellent
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they've adjusted the design in some way they didn't want to describe verbally, so I'm going in next week to have a look at the plans
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	fingers crossed it's a work of art, not a half-arsed mess
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	are you just getting pieces cut or did they have a customizable hex thingo already?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	no angr, the plans were half-baked to start with
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	full fab, inc design which they have done as part of the quote without charging me, which is nice of them
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh cool
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	if it gets prohibitive or w/e I've got small batches cut at GB Plastics + Blinds
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah the cutting's the easy part of this
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	if I wanted to reduce the price, best chance would be to go back to squares
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	~~or spend 4 weeks printing it~~
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ah nah you wanted the transparent didnt ya
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah I know, this is what printers are for :)
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah clear
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	it *is* a lot, but I'm justifying it as art :P
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I suspect on the tiny tiny chance that you ever quit using dice, you'd be able to sell the rig to another enthusiast
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	a solid investment surely
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can't just say that without telling us the cost
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if you're worried about us judging you for spending that much on a hole for dice that boat sailed with all the dice you bought :mikuwu:

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	god damn it the multiplayer is BT only
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	is this better than amiguru train
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	impossible
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i read the rules for daifugo but i don't really get it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway i look forward to playing Hatsune Miku Tycoon at the first #hobbies meetup
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	~1k
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	How do you tycoon a miku
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i was expecting more than 1k tbh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	those are rookie numbers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but yea it is a lot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's the card game tycoon or daifugo
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	with vocaloids lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they've been putting out a lot of low effort miku games lately
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't hate it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	jfc i was expecting half that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	whats the actual design anwyay
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	acrylic isn't super cheap but if the design is simple enough to cut/assemble you could probably save a lot of money makerspacing it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	then again its also nice just to pay someone to do it right and deliver it to your door
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Acrylic super spenny atm due to increased demand for shields and suxh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I brought these in and apparently im like office famous for them and two of the secretaries are like ‚Äúcan you tell me where you got these bc ur filing is really cute I see the bunny markers all the time‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I have a mental colour code for what they mean now lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	if you get the pink second bunny from the left it‚Äôs time critical signature
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Winky face bunny means complete and ready to upload to sponsor
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Closed eyes bunny means data errors here
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nice
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	try some miku post its and see how those go down
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	no we have a consultant who is a mega weeb I dnt wanna attract his attention
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	He‚Äôll talk about anime for hours
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	to anyone
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hahaha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no see
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the best thing to do is to shut those kinds of people down
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this happens to me all the time at school
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i mention something about anime and then the mouth breather will come and try and talk about stuff and i'll just be like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nope i don't watch bad anime
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nope don't like that one
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he‚Äôs too far in the hierarchy above me I cannot do it lol I‚Äôll open myself up to like, him wanting to actually talk about it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	even if they're talking about stuff i like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	consultants aren't even real people
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they make my life hell
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they don‚Äôt check emails or verify stuff
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	fckn
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably get paid too much too
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yes
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Lots
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i once did like a week of contract work for some really basic programming and design and during the initial meeting they were like we usually pay about 80 bucks an hour for consultants is that about where you're at
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and im like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	y-yes
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oh these are
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Medical consultants
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	They‚Äôre doctors
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea so their normal wage is that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	+ 100% for consultant
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yeah
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oncology consultant too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	true madness
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Looking around $400k pa
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its crazy to me that you could earn enough in 1 year to pay off a humble-sized house and land package
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like billionaires and shit whatever
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but these are normal ass people
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	hahaha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	theres no way someone earning 400k pa is not a millionaire right?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	unless they buy a lot of onaholes
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	not when they‚Äôre buying new audis every year and walking into clinic with $3000 Prada bags
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	which they do
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i suppose but like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	surely they sell their old audis
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I think they lease them and pay for the upgrades
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess they probably put their kids through private school and uni too
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	yeah
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	They have mansions with enormous mortgages
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	truly they are jsut built different
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	and private daycare and school for all the kids
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	haha brilliant, i got panda ones from bobcatinabox
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	One of our consultants brought in a mini fridge he was ‚Äúdone with‚Äù bc he bought one for each room and this was an old one
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It was like brand new lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	enough will to go through a medical degree and presumably spend some time in their field
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but also just fucken dumb
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	they have god complexes
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Dying patients come to them and they say ‚ÄúI have the experimental drug to help‚Äù and they feel like gods
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	meanwhile the trials team (us) do literally 99.99% of the whole trial
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	go do hard rubbish in eastern suburbs, you realise why not everyone on high six figures is a millionaire lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	10 percent of australians are millionaires
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	did you know that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	for some reason i can't comprehend that figure
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	They also take month long tropical holidays with their whole family probably costing 20-30k for the trip every year haha
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	One of the doctors goes to Hawaii every year with his 4 kids and extended family and flies business class with everyone
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That‚Äôs like
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I can‚Äôt even fathom
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hopefully moving glen osmond so maybe i'll range out to get my new furniture
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway tax the rich
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if the result of taxing the rich is they can't go on 20 thousand dollar holidays once a year that's really not a problem
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and anyone who argues that that is a problem should go and get fucked
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	another idea i just had is we pay parliament pollies 50k pa with bonuses given to parties that make good on election promises
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably there's some loopholes like "technically" achieving the promise but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno let's give it a go
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	No. Commission
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Or like, there's a pool of money and we crowdsource who gets it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	comission but it's based on how much the poverty line moves upwards
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	or, they're forced in to a life of asceticism and must rely on the goodwill of their constituents for food and shelter
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hahaha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the poverty line is half the median of household income
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and the dole is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	half the poverty line
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	really makes you think
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its a bit more than half but anyway
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ubi
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	cool you can get an uno compatible with an anime girl on it
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	finally
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it actually looks like a good dev board
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	micro usb and a bunch of onboard LEDs
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	and bobs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	sexu anime gorl
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wait
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	why the fuck don't i make my own uno compatible
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	with my own anime girl printed on it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	instead of pinkhair mc idiot face
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wait
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you could absolutely just grab the gerber file or whatever and send it to a fab
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	WAIT
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	surely someone offers this service
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	have seen it for printer stuff and drone stuff
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	dont remember specific services but I remember they were distant and bad at english
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	to be expected for pcb fabbing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	most of the onshore pcb printing places send their orders to china too haha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I cant find any of the places but I did find someone I used to talk about this to, messaged em haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	were they colour images? you can silkscreen whatever you want but it's usually only one or two colours
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ohhh yeah sorry I remember someone did purple PCB and got excited but it may have just been that
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	lets see anyways
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	these jennys look screen or uv printed
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Overkill but cool af https://reprap.org/wiki/Cyclone_PCB_Factory
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	notice how the lettering is non-standard even for the pin numbers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	aren't there like commercial enthusiast grade pcb printers these days
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	there's surface mount assembler machines idk about pcb printers I think ive only seen mills
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	those surface mount machines are satisfying af to watch, sec
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ahhh ok they have solder printers they use with precut pcb

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	found a 1bd at a good price and got on with the property manager so im a bit more hopeful than usual
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	house cost him $500k in 03

212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	might actually end up being able to afford it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ok well i just wasted 20 minutes looking at full colour PCB printing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	didn't find anyone offering custom jobs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	looks like the setup is too heavy to support it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	found these guys in au uv printing on boards https://www.littlebird.com.au/products/shakeup-board-only

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	FOR P-5
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	if you're choofing while gaming you want to keep the smoke AWAY from the devices :/
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	its 2021 fuckin vape losers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i assume all the shisha joints got fucking rekt by covid but i did enjoy a tea and smoke on a long night out with the boys every now and then
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	shisha was always nice with people who arent that excited about shisha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	and then you get those people that hog it to do smoke tricks and ask the staff for really specific things they dont know about and tell other customers what to do
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	first time we went couple of old afghani blokes took us under their wing and showed us the best combos of tea and shisha flavour haha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the dream
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea some of my old HS mates were big into shisha like that, it was a cultural thing for them but they also took it really seriously
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	never went with them but they'd complain about places not having specific things haha

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	witcher 3 was a solid 6/10 for me so i had no prior expectations
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but best i can tell cyberpunk isn't even a 6/10 cyberpunk game
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	let alone *the* cyberpunk game
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	witcher 3 was like an 8.5 for me
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	one of the few stories that actually grabbed me in a game
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	:ANGR: fuckin tlou trash
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i didn't care for it or the combat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	people all said you didn't need to play the other games but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i was lost

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I didnt play the other games, and actually loved the combat haha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	its commonplace now but it was a standout for natural feeling swordplay on release
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	better than AC imho
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MK-play-testers 35 bucks a session, 1 hour sessions
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	MK is the largest gamedev in SA, mostly mobile games but branching into console
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	their office is on pirie st
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	could be fun i dunno what they want tested
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	playtesting is just playing the game, not the sort of game testing you might think of where you try and break it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so it literally is "get paid to play games" lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	nice, signed up
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	was honest so might not get picked lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you never know, conan is coming out soon i think and you're probably close enough to that target demographic
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it could also be testing prototypes in which case it could be literally anything
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	word on the wire is they're trying a lot of different things lately
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the wire being half of everyone in my professional circle currently works there or has previously worked there lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Im watching Mythic Quest and its makes being a tester look really nice haha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	they have like a private couch room with coloured mood lights, and like the company pulls em out and talks to em occasionally
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	whereas I imagine the reality would be rank and file workstations and grind
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeeeaaaa

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	provide cool an funky office
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then probably work their employees dry

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I dont wanna be jack of all trades guy I wanna be responsible for one system lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think that kind of job is increasingly difficult to get
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah probs
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	all the jobs im thinking about are from mythic quest lol im so impressionable
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i should probably watch it now that the second season is over

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well i thought it was soon anyway i dunno
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah season 3 is mostly out
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there's a third???
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	apparently not according to wikipedia.. I swear my sonarr grabbed it tho
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	maybe its the specials labelled wrong
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but all the people who approve those decisions also take 20k holidays on their inflated salaries soooooooooo
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	if it makes anyone feel better
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	i sent off a huge 3 months in the works whistleblowing email to some jouranlists today

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	unsure if they'll do anything with it tbh
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I should update my news monitoring to do more than just naziwatch lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but theres legal, actionable things to be done with sourced evidence and ive been archiving things properly so cant be discredited
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im impressed you decided to go to the media about how much of a weeb that bloke is
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	:LSG:
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	yeah hes gonna really get it about all those anime emojis in the emails

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	isnt it Duttons special secret police now
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	if there isnt media attention drawn to this, the result is like 'internal investigaton' by LHNs themselves and those mean nothing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well its sa health i bet feds want nothing to do with it
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Woah

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but like one particular issue is literally an issue of data security, active treatment pathways, and something you'd actually hear and get angry about, like the average person
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	multiple issues converging
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	sounds complex, did you provide a TL:DR sensational headline?

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyone else sometimes randomly get mike shinoda's rap lyrics in the opening verse of linkin park's chart topping hit song "In the End" stuck in their head
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	yes enjoyed having the new billi at the end there
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	no matter how hard ya try
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	keep in mind that i designed this rhyme to explain in due time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what a flow
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	that greentext about the guy with 100s of 1000s of plays of that song, and that song only
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	what happened to 1200 techniques
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	There's a name I haven't heard in a while
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	were they even good schnook
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	or just catchy
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	idr
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I checked
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	they're very _medium_
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I know few of their songs, but what i knew i liked
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I don't have a metric for "good" really
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Im going back to riff worship üò† ‚öîÔ∏è ü§ò
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they were great if you liked alt/nu/rap rock
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh wow
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i used cheddar cheese with truffle for this toastie because i was feeling fresh and funky
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's a winner
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	funklicious
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but the cheese was very expensive so not happening again
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this intro fucks my shit up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYU-8IFcDPw
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the breakbeats over the strings :mikuloves:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fort minor was good too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that one album at least
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno if they did mor
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i associate this track with forza 1 on the original xbox
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuNOqnFkNgA
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah faint is fuckin sick
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	its like all the best parts of lp
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	confusing the shit out of yt music by going from Tomb Mold to Linkin Park
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	linkin park only released 2 albums prove me wrong
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	maybe 3
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	reanimation was cool too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i remember buying minutes to midnight, chucking it in my walkman and listening to it and when it was done i was like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	huh?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	highlighted: songs I've heard
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like i don't have any problem with artists evolving over time it's fine but it was such a departure from meteora that it was a shock
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	bleed it out was lazy safe copy/paste pop rock
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	that wasnt evolving it was checking out lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's also really sad in hindsight that you can track chester going from a kid who dealt with his life via anger and then getting older and internalising it instead
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats the thing with minutes to midnight
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it was the follow up to their height
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so instead of trying to give fans more they just did what they wanted
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	wow that was uncomfortable
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	just listened to papercut and it didnt go in to one step closer cos i was on shuffle
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	relistened to last 30s in to it, feel better now
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the CPHO is out for 2018-2020
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	this is the only thing i care about in it
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	look at that squishy face
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is funny to me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	peaked everywhere but did worse
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	almost as if chart hits are a completely meaningless way to assess music lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well the thing is
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	its for commercial viability rly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	billboard and aria etc chart sales
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so...
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what it means is that sales of M2M were huge on release
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but dropped off quickly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since that is just topped the chart for at least a week
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if you dug into it i bet you'd find that hybrid theory and meteora were higher on the charts for longer even though they didn't top everywhere
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	another random statistic, linkin park is one of the few artists to have a few albums in the top 200 simultaneously
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	with 8 albums in the top 200 at the same time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	linkin park has only released 8 albums
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what that means is that hybrid theory and meteora were still in the top 200 when they released their latest album in 2017
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway also M2M came out right when streaming became a thing and normalised piracy was in full swing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and like every other artist in existence their sales have never been as good as they were in the early 2000s haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	damn in the end has a billion plays on spofty
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	@Graf Eisen that lego game now has RTX!

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	thats gonna bother the shit out of me now hahaha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	how did you find out it had RTX without knowing the name
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	i read it in driver update notes
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	and then forgot the name

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dunno if you keep up with how much of a wanker nolan is
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	welp, guess I imagined that whole conversation
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	um excuse me my film is supposed to only be watched on an 800 foot imax screen with dolby atmos 88inch woofers with quantum tweeters
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	is that what he's like? how'd you like the movie btw
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	meh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	decent enough movie
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	about 30 mins too long
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	how hard does it try to be intelligent and unique
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	a bit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's not toooo wanky in that respect though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it does think it's core plot device is very clever though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and it does make for some great scenes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i don't think the viewer is quite supposed to "get" how it works
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	open to interpretation?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im sure it all made sense in the writers room
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no just complex to think about
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they take the piss out of other time travel stuff by talking about the grandfather paradox a few times
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	then dismissing it like "haha fuck knows"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	composer is ludwig
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	did mando
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i can see it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i assumed hans was working with someone lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	rad
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the soundtrack reminded me at times of the new deus ex games
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if they had music by hans
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is the iconic track i think https://open.spotify.com/track/0ASvZIiB2Ml32DlUhfaOhx?si=22555dfdb997425d
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	maybe it was in the trailer i don't know
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	brb rebooting router for hopefully 250mbps
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	China has lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization, accusing Australia of anti-competitive behaviour against its exports of railway wheels, stainless steel sinks and wind towers.
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Not the wheels!
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Tenet had too much hand waving for me
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	And oh my god that final battle/assault on the baddies' base was so hard to follow just in the traditional action scene sence
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	This is dope
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this was the one track i mentioned last night https://open.spotify.com/track/1AKIi40li4kyJHQKOuF3Qz?si=78798faa3f614524
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	same rolly synth
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the melody is very reminiscent of something else
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i can't place it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haha yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	coulda done without it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but i guess they really wanted a big finale
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Yeah but like, you couldn't even see the baddies that were attacking them so it felt really weird/empty
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Like staged instead of epic
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the scene ||after the battle when whats his face is like yea you recruited me and we had a really fun time|| was really great i liked that twist
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	He was good in it
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	So dapper
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	act 1 was definitely the high point
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which is kind of ironic given it had very little of the plot device in it lol
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	I didn't really love Dunkirk but feel it probably needs the same
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Full immersive setup to grasp his filmmaking
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dunkirk is much more of an audiovisual movie though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	tenet is more about wacky time stuff
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	O I watched Dunkirk in a drive in and it was rad even with my shitty car speakers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what if i told you
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have never been to a drive in
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and i didn't know you used your own speakers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	how does that work
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually to be honest i don't even know why people go to drive ins explain that too
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Hard pashing
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	U tune Ur radio to the drive-in's frequency
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i suppose id guessed that
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Why did I expose that spoiler :Waitwat: luckily stopped reading at the first word. Brain slow
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	honestly not a big spoiler
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you wouldn't know who i was talking about until you worked it all out anyway
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	It's so you can smoke weed watching a movie on a big screen
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Or drink or we
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	big admission time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the first time i ever made out with a girl
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	was in the cinema
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	with shrek the third playing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	truly shrek is a fundamental part of this generation
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	GRAF THIS IS THE COOLEST THING EVER
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	How have you never told us this
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess it was never topical
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i wish i remembered the scene
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it would make for a better story'
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	There were a lot of horny scenes in that film
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i remember literally none of it
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	So true
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well i guess that makes sense given i haven't seen it out of the cinema
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I fukken loved all the swat shit going down
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably the first third i was 800% nervous and the rest of the movie i was like

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the idea that you would be troubleshooting an old router and not your new one did not occur to me

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the difference is how quickly I can get the whole house up and running and restore my dhcp reservations lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	for some reason i seem to think 20mins pain repeatedly is easier than 1hr pain
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	its only dumb if I do it once more.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well its fair to assume that there will be other issues setting it up
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	i think so
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	there always is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	networking is literally the worst thing computers can do
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it should be legally mandated that networking equipment and software Just Works

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	go again but for someone with the current mental alacrity of a pebble

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wow that sounded really accusatory
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haha i just mean i don't talk to him much any more
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	fairo
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	there's a dhcp reservation and I dont know what its for
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	it looks important tho, better keep it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the address i gave it tells me its printer related but i only have one networked printer thing and that aint it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	DAE try to do the Down with the sickness noise when they burp
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	extremely satisfying when you nail it

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I wonder why
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Because grapefruit sticks and lemon is awesome?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Sticks sticks sucks
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	disagree
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Grapefruit best lemon is meh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he likes eating the pure sour lemon flesh

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Significant improvement
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I would pledge allegiance to that cool rat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lemon is way better than grapefruit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	only thing grapefruit is good for is grapefruiting your man
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	why do people insist on reminding me of that so often
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it‚Äôs good to make ur meds hit harder too

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	not an onion
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeah
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	what onion has a cleft
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	except those weird siamese onions
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	straight up not an onion I‚Äôm mad
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	they should be like, 1 in 5 max tho, not 100%
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I have feedback.
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the green leaf is an extreme throwoff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the assets come from a european supermarket pack so maybe its a weird regional onion
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	onions straight up dont have leaves like that
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	can you send me the address of the european supermarket pack creators I need to write a strongly worded letter
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh well ill leave it and see what the client says lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	graf you're gonna get fired do not do it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i won't get fired i wasn't in charge of getting the assets
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if i had to guess how we will remedy this
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	at least use a fake name and wear a moustache if you're going to present it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's putting a sign above them that says "Onions"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	upsetting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	our chilis are just shrunk capsicums streched on the y axis
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	that sounds quite adequate tbh
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Do some planes have like, aimable landing lights? I swear a plane coming in to land just had its lights pointing downwards, and they swept up to point at the runway
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Considering all the other shite planes do, that seems quite plausible
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the ones on the wings right next to the body on airliners do
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Or it was just nosediving at your house before it pulled up
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not sure why they'd move em during landing though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think on airbus maybe they dim the landing lights for the taxi lights
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so maybe it was on taxi mode and they switched to landing mode
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the taxi lights point out to the sides and down more
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but having said that it seems easier to just have more lights than a point of failure with moving lights lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	unless we're talking bizjet here
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	if anything it'd make more sense to have them more forward at the start and then angle them down, right?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	at the speed the plane is going the stuff ahead of you is more important
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	not straight down but like 15deg
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	once you're on the ground the pilot has to be able to see the taxiways and stuff which are on the ground
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so landing lights are like mostly forward
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and taxi lights are mostly down
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	er, turnoff lights is what they're called
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like that is taxi and turnoff lights
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	i wish i checked flightradar now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this reminds me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i need to write a light system for defender
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	blinky boys
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Make the lights blink in a subtle pattern, not uniform on off
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Secret morse code easter egg

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the hot tub streamers were kicked off twitch
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Haha bullshit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	now han is starting the hot tub live tweet trend
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	No way they'd drop amouranth
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe the ones not making them enough money
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	amouranth was listed in the list of people banned
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dunno if still banned tho
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Really? Colour me surprised and wrong
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Twitch: pretending to care
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	was that farting in to a mic and licking it stuff true, or just an onion article lol
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	That's how you get pinkeye
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	licking definitely
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Who did that? I want names and links
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	farting i believe
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	pretty sure amouranth or maybe she was just also mentioned in the article lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I've seen people do both those things separately
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Twitch won't change until there's ACA-style coverage about how our children are watching porn
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it doesn't really bother me they should probably just segment the audiences better
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	One guy I watch does a pretty good job of deepthroating his big mic
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	alpha

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah Im sure there's a place for it, just seems to be some hypocrisy from Twitch depending on how big your following is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	There's people who been permabanned in the past who haven't been nearly as lewd as these girls are being rn

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i switched to not using anti antiperspirant for a while and that worked as a preventative measure but ended up switching back because it wasn't reliable enough
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Non-white anti? I'm sure those exist in women's at least
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nivea has a mens range but the product itself isn't very good
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	people say just soaking in stain remover works
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	might give it a go on the weekend

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so you can't have any normal names for your characters
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because normal names are all taken
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	lol

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	basically
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i refuse to do that so i have weird names like Mieera and Leenaa
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	adding more letters does the trick
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Nice

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but then again i don't really like metal vocals so i guess it doesn't mean much
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i guess it's closer to baby metal than [popular metal band]
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it‚Äôs interesting
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I like babymetal

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think i have heard pelican before

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	970 evo or evo+?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the evo plus is really incrementally better so does it matter?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	but yeah i think they're really similar so i'd go with the cheaper
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the plus would be yeah defs the not-plus would be meh, if you have the extra $45
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	far as i can tell the only benefit to the plus is slightly better sustained write
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which isn't really a concern
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i should see what my current os drive is getting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not evo speeds thats for sure
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wait never mind i thought i still had a cheap ass crucial in there but it's a WD black apparently
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so probably not far off
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually apparently it fucking blows lmao

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats coming from china to make it less than 1/3rd the price landed pc stores are selling it for lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	btw guys im playing astroneer again and it is so damn cute highly recommend if you want some chilled out survival/exploration game

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I can't play those games alone though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I have no interest in learning how things work, progressing, etc

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	for survival coop games i reckon there needs to be combat that benefits from having more than one sack of meat
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like valheim or 7 days
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not that i'd play 7 days agaiun

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's very clear they've never done a unity before
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's also not clear to me why they want it in unity in the first place but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Pays the bills lol

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Probably because if they don't they don't get their bonus
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah ticket it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the more the merrier :smileyfritz:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Earlier I watched a man take off his mask as he got onto a tram
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Now that's big braining it

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I bought a thing

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	biccie and lighter in gfs dressing gown pocket
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	now lighter exploded with tooth hole in it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	luckily looks like he did it through the fabric
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	he didnt get the biccie :frownfritz:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	taste of lighter fluid may have turned him away
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	he did a big vom after
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	i gave him a consolation biccie now tho
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh wow it charges through the case like wireless buds
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	250 bucks is a stupid amount of money for a controller and i don't think it's ever going to feel as good as you'd expect for that amount of money
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it sure is Built Different
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	jfc
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	that is a lot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i use my controller a lot and it was getting a bit naff so i needed to buy a new one and i thought why not go big and then go home straight after and play with it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the sticks feel
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	great
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	tfw the cool thing doesnt randomly drop price :ANGR:
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I think people use them for sims if they dont wheel, is that the one with individual trigger vibes?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats just the xbox one controller
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh lol cool
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this has paddles on the back
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the impulse triggers only work in UWP apps though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so steam games don't have support
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ah yeah I think the sim peeps were playing on console anyways
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea its really handy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can feel the wheels slipping
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	brakes even
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	locking even
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	fuck me
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	nah I got ya haha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	feeling slip would be handy too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you get a different texture on different surfaces which isn't that useful in F1 but very useful in rally
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	My wheel FFB rattles the shit out of my rig over kerbs, but I like the effect so not fixing it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	you can get chair rumblers and configure them per-wheel which sounds pretty cool but prohibitively expensive

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	doing a fw update on my controller
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you know how it be
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway gave it a name
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeahbud
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	gday gav
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you know when you rotate a controller stick around it's extents
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and you get that plastic on plastic friction
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is i guess polished alu on polished alu and it feels frictionless
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like a bearing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i imagine that will degrade
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	sexxxy
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	sounds like a keep-in-case device
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea lucky it comes with one haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the shoulder buttons still suck though
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	you know whats worse than that plastic on plastic scrape? the cheap 3rd party controllers that were spongy at extents
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	microswitch garbage they've been using since the original S controller
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	is it the same problem its always been
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can push it anywhere
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the 360 ones felt really cheap and not enough positive feedback
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it's still clearly a microswitch
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	on 360 you couldn't push em in closer to the middle since they pivoted
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but they fixed that on the x1
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ah cool
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but every other part of it feels premium af
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have just been caressing it so far

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think that's the market discord is targeting
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	line lets creators sell their own sticker packs too which is cool for artists

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the mix is interesting but just ends up being really average

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	But yeah last week or two when at work I'll be just minding my own business and then suddenly I feel my eyes squint and twitch without me doing it manually (if that makes sense)
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	And when I notice it happening, I try to regain control but can't prevent the involuntary action from happening.

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	And yeah i can set my screen to yellow n shit and it still is

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Bully them to buy you nicer screens

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Screen is the nicest thing on these stupid macs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	A change from previous gens with their dogshit screens that burned in permanently or got huge ugly dark patches after less than a year
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Bad mood day üò°
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	another round of jo≈æin z ba≈æin should clear that right up
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Unfortunately can't really dip that at work now with manatees spyware

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Heard today we've been shopping again
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	wait what
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	they monitor you?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Bought out another big parent company
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Not sure if actually monitored but defs possible
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Forcepoint
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	It at least filters "non-work" sites
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	And times some shit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So it's probably at least logging stats
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Peripherally related, a guy at work just spent like a grand on a touchscreen mp3 player
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Works though. Half the time I go to look something up, I think "oh this'll be blocked" and don't even bother
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	So like, a phone?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Playing music is something that benefits more from a physical UI than most things, surely
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Audiophile stuff I assume
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah i think so
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	thats what we said and he rolled his eyes at us lolol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I guess i think of mp3 player as thing in pocket you just want to change volume or song by touching not looking
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	its probably FLACs or something
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Hate that everything is touch screen now
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Shitty car ui
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	It's 2060 and we all can't indicate cos there's no tactile feedback in the buttons
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Just can't do anything (excl the 4 buttons on the wheel) without taking eyes off the road
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	At least use contextual screen keys ffs
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Rhytidoponera maniae

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ive been post neckbeard for years
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its just usually stubble rather than clean
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	necksandpaper
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ive been meaning to shave for like 6 months
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actual shaving is a pain i nthe ass
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually i lied my neck gets a clean shave every time i go to babrer
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah "shave" for me means <1cm
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	barbara
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	walters
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ann
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway recommend oneblade if you want to be able to trim and do an acceptable shave job with the same tool
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dry too!
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	i was tempted when you first mentioned it but Im still not even sure it'll be better than my generic dept store one
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it doesn't do a better job than disposable razors
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and it doesn't do a better job than normal beard clippers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it does the clipper job on par and the disposable razor job good enough
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so it's a win
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its also a lot easier to use than disposables
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	My beef with my beard clipper is it sucks when it gets long
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	_and it always gets long_
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	my options are prehack with scissors or just go over the same spot x1000
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if you run a long beard you should be using full sized hair clippers tbh
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I should go see my dad and ask for facial hair lessons
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	mr han keeps using my leg razors for his face but he only shaves like once a week so idc
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	he‚Äôs got I think between seven and twenty facial hairs
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	that doesnt make any sense, mens razors are 10x better than womens
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ohhh is it a convenience thing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it‚Äôs bc he never buys razors lol

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Recovery is going now I should get a not shit USB for this sort of thing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I had to take off my cpu cooler
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Because it's one of those LORGE BOYE CoolerMaster ones everyone's got
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And the m2 is right under it ofc
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I was thinking about getting a cheaper m2 ssd in a wee case with usb
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Anyway I don't know where my thermal paste is so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It'll be fine
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	wait what
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	did you just leave what was there or leave it nekkid
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's got paste I just didn't replace it like you're supposed to
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	yeah nah that'll be fine
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	paste science is a lie
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I'm sure it matters if you're chasing minute overclocks
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I am not
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Don't remember if I even oced at all
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	iirc I googled stable oc 8600k and just plugged in the first result
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Thinking I'll order a tf when my letter of offer comes in though
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	was it you who asked me to keep an eye out? haha important thing to remember probs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I wanna play raytraced Minecraft
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It was
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	excellent
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	But knowing me I'll buy whatever looks good when I want it rather than wait for deal
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	theres pretty much always a deal atm so whenever you're ready really
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Actually
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I should probably wait to see what compy situation is at work
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	It's not unlikely they will requisition a laptop for me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And ofc I need a Razer Blade 14 to undertake my duties
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Cool
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Oh I clicked the wrong option
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Do you think checking these excludes them from formatting
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Or includes them in formatting
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Because the dusk it says it excluded is in that list with a different drive number
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Tick to save
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And it has no partitions or anything
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	or just do what the pros do and unplug shit
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Better sage
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Safe
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I would if I could remember which one was which lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	do it at the drive end lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	No I mean
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I don't know which one is which drive letter
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	it'll say the capacity on the drive
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Which is the important one
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ohh right
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Hmm
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I mean I know the system backup is on one of the HDDs I guess
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	even tho they're all diff capacities ü§î
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	So I only can fail once
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Most of them are uhh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	What's the world
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Comjoinulated
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Linux isos
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Enpairated
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Intertwinned
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	This sounds like a thing i haven't heard of
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Ok well I picked the wrong hdd
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Because of course I did
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Eeny meeny
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Anyway here's a macro of some fluff that was in my cpu heatsink
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	This was a colossal fucking waste of time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And now I know not to bother with image drive what the fuck evers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Turns out they're only meant to work with the same drive, but you can get lucky and it just sometimes works in new drives
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Interesting
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Did it many years ago with a hdd to ssd in my lappy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Can't remember the software used
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i think it might work ok with single drive machines
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the windows one i mean
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	theres definitely software that does it properly and lets you select drives
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Oh windows has the option built in?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	We (ok my partner at the time did it) used some other utility
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I never actually learnt how to do it, but he said it was easy
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea probably theres software that does it but now im annoyed and just gonna wipe lol
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah that does suck
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	My condolences on your lost time

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I don't think I could do anything important enough to matter
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Plus then I'd have to fight for a place at one of the remaining bastions of not-MCC
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	its better to be in the buying company than the bought one lol

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't know why i trusted it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i know it can't be trusted
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and now i have the weirdest craving for cabana
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	those things aren't related fyi but i would have gone to bed by now if i wasnt waiting
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	it do be like that sometimes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh i didn't mention it but same day i bought that xbox controller
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i also bought 180 bucks worth of anime yolo
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	... which was two series on bd
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they keep fucking around with streaming services
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and all the apps fucking suck
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im sick of it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	keep em sealed and pirate em now
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	there is a certain ritualistic satisfaction to be found ripping the BDs, burning the subtitles in handbrake, and adding them to plex
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	r... really?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it also means i don't have to deal with finding quality releases
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	sonarr can do that for you
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and they always upload in some wackadoodle format at a bitrate 8000 times higher than necessary
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	um yes my 20 minute episode of 1080p anime *needs* to be 2gb large
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i used to pirate all my anime
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	piracy in general just isn't worth the effort any more
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I type in the show and then it turns up in plex üòé
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if i believed you were only doing that for shows you owned that would be discussion worth following
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh god no
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I dont watch anything niche or indie enough to bother paying for
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Woah the windows setup installed the display driver while I was going through its 8 million screens
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	That's never happened before
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	so convenience
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	The year is 2021

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well seems right anyway
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i love how freelancer installs are on the root of 3 different drives
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	one of these installs is at least a decade old and been carried forward
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	finally it finished calculating my steam folder delete
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Haha

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Mornin‚Äô
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	gday gday gday
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I sent out a survey yesterday to help us plan an internal IT newsletter
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	The responses are...
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	https://tenor.com/view/film-filmproduction-scriptsupervisor-arresteddevelopment-bluth-gif-3471381
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Less than stellar?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	anywhere between "idgaf" and "each newsletter should do my job for me"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	make the newsletter include
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Stupid ticket of the week
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ticket clearance rates
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and a message from IT to the general organisation which is always filled with passive aggression
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I've been trying to avoid this because of how much noise there will be, but there are a couple of requests
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	We once did a stupid ticket for the month email blast because we we‚Äôre so done with people not checking the FAQ section. Plus it was a friendly reminder that it was there right in the browser as a button but we got in trouble because it was considered ‚Äòharassment‚Äô
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	of course lol
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Best part was before we sent the blast, the person in question told us to go fuck ourselves because why would anyone read a faq when they could just message us direct.
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	I wonder if that's considered harassment
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Really makes you think ü§î
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Why I moved into installations because less drama (not really)
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Part of my frustration with previous boss was behind closed doors he'd be like "FUCK these lazy CUNTS they can go fuck themselves if they're not gonna read doco"
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	but then in reality he's like "nah just do it" for any request
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Big jinkies
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	at the end of the day as a support group the organisation will expect IT to bend to the everyday wills of the rest of the org
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so you can think fuck the users but you can't actually do fuck the users
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or your department gets cleaned
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	what I want to do, is help one of the 100 people waiting for genuine support
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	not tell adults how to do their job and/or that no I can't do it for them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you have to deal with that in every department i guess the difference is it directly affects IT KPIs
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	we have no KPIs is the other weird arm. My colleagues give me shit for wanting them because they're a meme in most workplaces
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no bonus for ticket performance?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	LOL
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	What is that? Datacom??
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	If I do zero tickets or 80 in a week, same dealio
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nice fuck the users i guess ignore all the garbage
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Sames if I just reset passwords all week, or if I roll out entirely new technologies to thousands of people lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	nah state health commissioning and funding body
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	our IT just had a ton of turnover and the new IT are just
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	valueless
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	That‚Äôs just a little bit of a whole lot of wack.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they immediately started removing permissions from teachers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so now we have to go through them to do minute shit like install a program
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and it's like don't ou have better shit to do?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	evidently not
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Soz for confusion I was replying to the who does bonuses for work when really they don‚Äôt.
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ah right
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i couldn't pull from a git repo on my teacher office PC because i couldn't accept the windows firewall popup thing because i wasn't elevated
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	help my computer dun work
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	lel
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	But rly
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	I know State health is garbage, rather build underground tunnel and build another stadium for no reason.
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	sorry but this is fine lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The new EMR rollout nuked my comp
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's really fucking not
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we teach game development
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It just don‚Äôt work now lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	they should defs work with technical teachers to make sure they're set up
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh wait is everyone there teaching similar???
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	pulling git repos is literally a daily occurance
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	for every teacher?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeah all we teach is technical skills
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	omg amateur hour
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ah k disregard me then. I was thinking like, the cobbling teacher should NOT have admin or anything beyond 80/443
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea sure at tafe definitely
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but we're hyper specialised in an industry revolving around windows PCs
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if we can literally create video games we can probably not fucking obliterate a windows install
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	send your IT dept those articles about how Linux Desktops are the future regularly. They'll appreciate it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Throw in a suggestion that they should use blockchain
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	"tried logging in with my blockchain 2fa and it didn't work please advise"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Priority: URGENT Subject: cannot install bitcoin wallet to pc
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	no more like "could we use blockchain for the meeting room bookings system?" or "maybe you could ask the vendor to store it in the blockchain"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway these teacher PCs are single user and students can't access them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they're supposed to be open for us to do whatever we need on them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	new it dept didn't get that memo
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	just get remote access to home
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	then do everything tehre
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just give us admin on our own fucking computers lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh they also fucking LOVE remotely wiping PCs without telling anybody
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so you'll come in to work, jump on the classroom teacher PC, and all your local files will be gone
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the ol' cattle vs pets decision is nothing without user buy-in lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea i mean if we knew they would be wiped every friday at 6pm no big deal
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but just randomly yeeting all the local files is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	very annoying
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	do they give you a centralised place to store stuff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its not catastrophic by any means
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just very annoying
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	or is it like, DIY or GTFO
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we do have onsite storage but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we're not running our unity projects off a network drive haha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	meeting time pray for me
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	yeah nah you ain't doing that
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	:DuckPray:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we're also office 365 or w/e so all our docs are on there but it's like you set something up for next week or something and then come and its gone

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Checked what IP you get to keep and then taken it all anyway cos fuck the police?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	eh?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im trying uber eats to new place for first time
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	doesn't have street numbers out here
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	very cool
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	things that entertain me
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	when we were first getting around the alcohol/drugs dataset here, I pulled the Victorian version for guidance/comparison
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Occasionally, the Victorian version still shows up here and there in place of our versions ü§£
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Reading titles and picking up context is 2hard4most
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	:kek:
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i got four more students to mark for last module
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	really can't be bothered
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	takes so much brainpower
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	too much brain
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	not enough rest
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	every 6 months this dude flips his lid at me because top lines of page 2 onwards doesnt get printed correctly
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	and every 6 months I remind him it's because his letterhead is 600x143 not the max 600x140
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	one day he'll remove 1800 pixels for me
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	We're not "allowed" to do graphic design for providers but getting pretty tempted to send it to their IT who can send it to the guy who can send it to us
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	tell him to call 1800 FUK OFF
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh no
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this guy on another server has beautiful digital art as his profile pic and cover image
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and a link to his art instagram
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so i was like ok cool i wanna see more
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it was not his art
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	oh no
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i feel betrayed
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	marketing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well it didn't work because now i won't even say kind words about his not very good art
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not that i will say bad words to him about it either
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i got on the gear to finish off this marking
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	might have to order these focus pills again
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	lol are yours better than Hans
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they're non medicated so i doubt it
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but given they're non medicated i probably don't struggle as much with focus üòÑ
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Sooooo snake oil? Or just nothing with a pharm name lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	gamer supplements
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	LOL
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	placebo or not they work
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	you dont get to hang shit on modafinil if you buy gamer supplements
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hang what shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im saying i didn't get a prescription because i don't suffer from lack of focus that much
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I took your response yesterday as criticism of them but it actually wasnt, ignore me lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nah i was just talking shit
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Do you think they sell gaming supplements at those MR MUSCLE powder warehouses?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	or w/e they're called
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Gamer supps
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	They don't but they should.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably, gaming sup companies do seem to market to gym people too
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	relabel your preworkout and double your market
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	for sure
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i mean these things are mostly creatine so
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	basically
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if i could get away placeboing myself onto sugar tablets for various things i would
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I wouldnt be surprised if modafinil or similar was in some of them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	these things do seem to do something though, i gave one to a coworker and he reported the same focused mindset without prompt, besides the name being "Focus" lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so a strong placebo if nothing else
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they also make your pee fluro so that's fun
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Im pretty sure I just created an account for an Adelaide Social member in one of our systems, but I kinda dont wanna ask em in case it creeps em out haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeah that would probably be a breach of ethics too lol
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	idk
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	"hey I saw you working at cibo at the port on saturday" is effectively the same right?
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	(they're not a client they're a worker)
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hmm
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno i think its different when it's not actually seeing them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it feels slightly voyeuristic
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	we had warm interactions via email cos they were pleased with my responsiveness
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh if you had actual email thats probably fine
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i thought it was just work order create account
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just gave someone the ol' you didn't try hard enough
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the measure of a student is if they receive that feedback and then try harder
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the ones that don't are doomed
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	https://www.lalal.ai/
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	unfortunately this stuff only works if there's good separation between vocals and the instrumental
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	otherwise you get weird vibrato and ducking on the vocals
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	usually works great on EDM because there's really clear divisions between instruments in the mix
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	sooo try it with some recorded-in-a-well death metal, gotcha
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	was it jimmy recard?

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i just tried that particular one on some jpop and got predictable results
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	vocals in the instrumental and the vocals

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but actually metal (maybe not well metal) might work
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	that's pretty easy to do manually if you get used to holding shift every second letter

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway music genres where instrumentation is fairly standard may work ok even if the EQ on the instruments isn't "standard"
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so bog standard guitar, bass, drums, screm, might have good results
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but if you throw bagpipes in there it will probably chuck a wobbly

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	At least hating her makes it more fun when she gets squished or impaled

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	im not following you is it meant to be lara croft? when does she go full predator
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Idk what qualifies as full predator
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I assume murdering cunts from the trees
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	does that ever happen?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I am indeed talking about lara croft

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	As if it wasn't bad enough in the old days when she was just slaughtering loads of animals because they'd been possessed by spirits trying to protect their damn graves

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Part of my problem is I'm not sure. I'd like a camera that doesn't suck arse, but that's more down to the software running it for my purposes. I'd prefer not round edges if poss (I want to put it in a case anyway. Want a 3.5mm jack if I can, but having not researched yet, I'm guessing everyone's dumped that by now. Figure i should get 5G too.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Everything else is probably covered under "your phone is old so anything would be an improvement"
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Might have to pick 3.5mm or 5g
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah :(
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	OH
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	no wait
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	pixel 3 doesnt have it but 4a 5G does
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	It's not something I use often, so I don't really want to invest in wireless headphones
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'll look that up when I get home, thank you
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Realistically the things that really matter are the everyday things I won't think of until I notice that I hate them after buying
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	there are 3.5mm to usbc adapters and they're not too annoying for ongoing use if you leave em attached to headphones
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Oh ok, that's good
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	That would be fine then
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I only ever use headphones on planes
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	An adaptor is no biggie :)
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	might wanna verify that for whatever you pick, but pixels come with one
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah nice
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	there are generic ones which bodes well for 'works with any phone'
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I assume any phone will still let you add custom ringtones n shit, just nobody does

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	If you want a case do t buy anything esoteric or it becomes a pain in the ass

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	It was from redbubble. Print on demand
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	If you want same brand then you can narrow your search by just seeing what phones they have cases for haha
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Ha I'm not that married to the case

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	Print in demand you might struggle even with midrange phones
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	There's a lot of them
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	most of those services are apple/samsung centric
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	And a vast majority of people have flagships
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	google too nowadays
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	I've had good luck finding skins and stuff for my oneplus

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just bury your face in their fluff
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I remember kitten huffing
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	The best high money can buy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Personally wouldn't do it though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Being in cat house at all makes my throat gross
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I prefer to huff baby's tears

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that would be

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	thats the main logical reason not to
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wait i can just ask
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Get the 3080 deal
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Then sell me the 3080 and I'll give you my 1080 :P
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't need a 3080 and it's not much of a deal
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	$2350 with a zen 2
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the 3600 is worse than my current cpu
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i will consult the arbiter of all decisions
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	!decide should i buy this pc before i move
860734581429633025	Meeku#8633	No!
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	üôè
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	her wisdom is final
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Turns out miku is yer mum
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Bpctech $2699 with 5600
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	3080 and better parts all round
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I haven't looked at the secondhand market, but are there heaps of people selling everything but the gpu since no shop will sell an unbundled gpu?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	probably yea
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	Pre much
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	They dropping
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	There is hope
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	where's this bpctech?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	only found one foe 3k
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	On OzB today or yesterday
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the one today is 3k
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	I'll have a look in 5
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if i can get a 3080 for same price great
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but that seems unlikely
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Sucks to be someone who ordered a card but still waiting because companies are putting cards in builds instead of fulfilling paid orders
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	(Not me, just generally)
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't think they're doing that
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the ones selling these builds are places people generally go for builds rather than components
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also im pretty sure the cards come cheaper for the retailer as bundles themselves
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	with mobos and etc
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so they can't reasonably separate
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its still on the manufacturer to catch up to demand... and they can't do much with the silicon shortage + crypto
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Do you need the 5600x is the main question
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like i said not going to bother upgrading unless it's a cpu upgrade too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or a great deal on card only
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	And yes you can get 3080 at that price
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can get a 3080 by itself for that price
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or in an otherwise meh pc
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	or in a deal that doesn't exist right now
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the 3600 wouldnt be an upgrade for ya?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	nope
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ah yeh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	more threads but core performance is worse
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/636310 thats only +250 for the 5600x
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well also +140 for cooler and 100 for ram haha
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	oh you need 32?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	wait actually i got 2 8gb already i don't need ram
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	need is a strong word
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	get the cooler cheaper elsewhere or just air cool like a genius
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	We just agreed with our landlord to buy the place we're renting currently. üéâ

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	in my experience nobody knows what the fuck pizza tastes like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	we could eat the same pizza and give it totally different descriptions
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i would describe dominos in exactly the same way you just did
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Maybe I just have a defective pizza hut cos this can't just be difference of opinion
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	I miss dine in pizza hut
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have experienced this live with CBD dominos
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i was like wow tastes like cardboard and a mate was like huh? delicious
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	CBD dominoes _is_ defective bruh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that doesn't explain why he thought it was delicious
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Last time I did the dine-in thing they never had more than one pizza out at a time. All you can eat my arse. Total ripoff
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	bday parties at salisbury pizza hut :shades:
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe friend likes cardboard? Eating paper is a thing
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Yeah same schnook they were such fucks about it. Before we paid "just let us know what you want prepped", after we paid "oh you haven't finished yesterday's garlic bread yet"
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Maybe your friend has defective taste buds, what does he like to drink?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	happens to often to be a him problem
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	hence nobody knows what the fuck pizza taste like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all our brains just make shit up
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	We're working at the bottom of the rung here
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	that's where it matters though
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Does everybody like, tony tomatoes, hey Bianca, pizzalola, chicco palms?

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Idk man a dominoes coupon gives you $15 pizza but you pay only $20 for absolute premium shit
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Elsewhere

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	huh? it costs like 40 bucks for 3 pizzas and 3 sides from pizza hut
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	dominos has a similar deal
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Finding a good local place is great. Pity every fucker sells out to someone who ends up fucking up the quality and running the place into the ground üò° :frowney_fritz:

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Ah well it works to justify fancy pizza for me so I'm sticking to my mindset hahaha
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	I miss eagle boys too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I'd buy fancy pizza every time if there was one near me :(

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	First time around (qld) got market value + 10%
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Gonna live right on main road again?
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Don't know I don't want to move.
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	But we might move further down south.
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Not ideal but housing in my area is not cheap + wayy smaller block.
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	I feel sorry for next door they paid $580k and they might not get that.
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	From what I heard, it going to be council value and not market.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	sounds dodgy
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	It government bullshit baby
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you should declare your own country and appeal to the UN
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it won't work but maybe it will catch media attention and just generally be a pain in the ass
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Heyy that's an idea.

212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	From previous acquisition for the corridor it sounds like it was hit n miss for getting actual value but pretty damn close, my FIL who pays way too much attention to it said last night that all properties get $50k compensation tacked on as well.
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	My partner works with a girl who owns the new beyond bouldering at Clovelly park and they've just spent 1.2 developing it on Marion councils advice that it won't be demoed. They got the news yesterday it will be demoed.

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Yeah I heard that they won‚Äôt be compensated which is cooked. Imagine dumping a whole lump sum into something to only lose it
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	sort how it goes, greater good and all but yeah it would be heartbreaking for those that built memories and rewarding for those that were in the know before the general population and bought into the area

These Acts protect the rights of individuals affected by acquisition and articulate the process. > > The Department will consult with all impacted parties as the project moves into its delivery phase. If impacted, the Department will contact you to negotiate: > > an owner initiated settlement > This is where the owner and Department willingly enter negotiations to reach agreement about the sale of the property. This process can start at any time once the project‚Äôs land requirements are finalised and enables early resolution. > a compulsory acquisition > This process starts when the Minister for Transport formally approves the project corridor and the Commissioner of Highways determines the land required. Once the compulsory acquisition process has started, the Department must negotiate a final agreement. > **If you have been informed or believe that your property may be impacted and would like to talk to someone from the project team, please call the Northern Connector information line on 1300 916 221.** Alternatively, for more information about the land acquisition process, please refer to the attached Fact Sheet.

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	actually considering I mostly print little things, the extra volume might be annoying for resin usage

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the anycubic one seems to be the only reasonably priced wash and cure

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not that I've tried ultrasonic, but spinny seems adequate
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	well I don't know about labs tbh
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but it's a little prop on a bearing stuck in the bottom of the bucket, with magnet drivers in the machine base
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its what they use to stir solutions for longo times
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they use free floating ones that you just plop in
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	funny times when you forget to switch to cure mode and the rotating plate flings your prints off the edge üòÜ
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ultrasonic would work a lot better than just normal agitation
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's probably non-trivial to do in that format though
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno if you can just stick an ultrasonic pad thing to the bottom of the rotating plate and call it a day

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Still going on about the same thing, apologies - I'm tempted to buy the top model samsung just to get supposedly great cameras (even though it's not like I'm taking fancy pics ever) am I crazy? It's been like 3 days and I'm already sick of thinking about it.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Not really expecting any helpful advice since it's entirely preference, just externalising my dumb thoughts thanks
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Also is it crazy to anyone else that phones now have camera *arrays*?
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	How long have you had your existing phone?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Uhh 2016 i think
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I think this model was 2014 though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Getting a little long in the tooth
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	It been 5 years, longer than most people keeping their phones.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Also crazy to me, but I guess it's the same as a computer
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It bothers me in ways I can‚Äôt articulate
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Right?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	You can get the same shit for like 300bux in a single point and shoot, but they do fit it all in a tiny spot
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Technology be wildin'
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	mr han was gonna buy a new phone for the camera abilities but he bought a DSLR instead and still has a phone from 2014
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Nice
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I can agree with that
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but also I am blown away by this phones camera lol so much better than my Samsung
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it has settings I‚Äôve never used because the point and click is so good I cbf
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I could get a new camera easy. But moving files around ugh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Get a phone that is way too powerful with way too much storage
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	And never be disappointed
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Also, I give bad phone advice so take with a salt lamp
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Not a grain of salt
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	A whole lamp

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	100% will still be disappointed though
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I will inevitably hate all of the software
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Hence why phone camera good
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Samsungs be bloated (at least last time I had one)
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah probs ay
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I hate that it won't let me delete the stupid apps i don't want
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	at least apple keeps all its bloatware out of sight mostly so I don‚Äôt get pissed off seeing apps I can‚Äôt remove
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I like the illusion of control
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Well i can delete, but it redownloads at first opportunity
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oof
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	iphones are insidious in the way that you are like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna let this thing run my life‚Äù and 20 mins later you‚Äôve thrown away your debit card because Apple Pay is better
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	got sucked in

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Apple is great when working within apple's ecosystem
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Just a shame, no one else can do it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	If I get a big boy I'll get onto a "plan" for the first time ever. Always had prepaid because it's always been cheaper for my light usage, but the phone+plan deal is the most economical way to get the big boy, even with the plan costing me double what I pay now
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Would mean not watching my data anymore
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Slowly making my way into the 2010s

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Yeah I use my phone for everything so data usage = heavy
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Fair

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	My experience is if you haven't got used to Samsung already it's a massive pain to
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Also the latest ones iirc are huge? Idk if you're in to that
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Yeah i feel morally against big phones for some reason, but practically it probably makes no difference to me
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Worth checking it has the battery to match too
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Trying to put aside my prejudice when i can't work out why i have it

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	My gf still does the whole "turn off every radio you're not actively using" but I don't bother
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Oh yeah I turn off connectivity unless I'm actively using it
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Which is rarely more than 8 hours
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Not to say my usage won't change if I have a more usable device I guess

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	Gave up
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so many inspections during work hours
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	silly
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	agents doing whatever they want because they can
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	not like they're crying for renters atm
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	noticed unilodge opened to non-students
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but they are definitely no pets
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I asked my friends who are renting out their house next year if they'd make it pet-friendly
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they said no
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	they have a cat in there already
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I mean they own a cat, the cat will be gone, but it's not like the place is untainted by pets
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	did you tell em they're fuckheads
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	üò§
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i cannot wait for legislation regarding these
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	big slap upside the head
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	no I just said "will it be child-friendly?" because I'm passive-aggressive and we moved on
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	but yeah 'bout time that stopped being the business of people who get money back if shit gets damaged
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	getting the feeling i won't find a suitable place without nepotism
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	probs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I wonder if offering to suck the agent's dick might help
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	honestly for a favourable lease....
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the way i sort through properties is play hunt the green pin on domain map
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then scan the info for pets
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	all two of them
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	my heart skips a beat when i see pets negotiable
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	usually it's no or just not in there
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	DB Philpotts or w/e are the worst
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	NONE of their listing seem to have pet stuff listed
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	have you looked at stuff outside of domain/realestate?
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	gumtree, for example
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i have yea and facebook

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	usually share house or house
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	being particular hasn't worked so far so i'm switching to shotgun approach

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	yeah threw me briefly
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I suspect the owner didn't know how to fill the form
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	though it might be that inspections are from the same date as available
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	like, not doing inspections until last tenant is gone
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Makeup remover will take it off (wipe or liquid) if it‚Äôs nail polish it will be hard and crusty and u can shave it off the towel fuzz with a razor

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	i dont get the issue with pregnant person lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	X
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	The issue is it‚Äôs ambiguous when there is specific section based criteria
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Anyway the HREC committee agreed with me
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	what about intersex people that carry babies to term
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	They don‚Äôt meet eligibility criteria
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ah yeah
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so doesn‚Äôt matter won‚Äôt make it past screening
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	This is a survey only for participants who have made it through pre screening
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	therefore they are all biological women who have admitted to giving birth
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I get that its sex based but I'd lean towards the vague terminology on the offchance someone no longer identifies as female
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Regardless of sex, identity is meaningful
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	better safe than sorry kinda thing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	nope vague terminology is very frowned upon in human research
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	If you use a specific term to define a participant early on, you are committed to that term. By specifying and screening only for sex: female, there‚Äôs no issue with consistently using that past pre screening
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	I get ya, but I don't get the circumstance in which pregnant person could be misconstrued
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	it doesn‚Äôt matter, you remove the opportunity for it to be misconstrued
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ah true, I guess if thats in the screening its almost completely unlikely you'd encounter this situation anyways
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That‚Äôs what the ethics committee is for, deciding how realistic that is
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	It‚Äôs fun
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I think ima try and get on ethics board for good and do reviews
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I strongly enjoyed it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	how to enjoy stuff
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	be interested in it I guess
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I think bad research is embarrassing and infuriating it‚Äôs interesting to me to see it done well, fill in that sentence with the things u like hehe
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	if only it was that easy

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	the platform as I see it is twofold. 1. If you want a nice sporty looking car that is fuel friendly and enjoyable to drive. 2. The start of your racecar foundation with not only thousands of new parts constantly made for it, but affordable enough to modify into a nice track car that you can enjoy.
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	My gut feeling about the BRZ is that people dislike it because it was the rebirth of Toyota's performance direction, and they didn't give it forced induction.
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	i think he just chops n changes pocket rockets often and this one was probably too stock for him

231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	He also gave up a KTM with big power for it.
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	See this is why we as consumers deserve nothing but shitty crossovers is because when manufactures do make sport car, "enthusiast" fucking shit all over it and it doesn't sell. And manufactures aren't going to keep selling sports cars if there ain't no money in it.
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	We are just doomed to Nissan quashi or however they spell it

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	Skype for me was due to Osu!
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	skype is balls and always has been, never used it except when I had to
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	we were made to use ICQ at work back in call centre days

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	no the key type is SA and they are blank
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	No pun intended
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i asked them to modify my order because i forgot to get one to replace the escape key
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but they didn't even respond
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so not ordering from them again
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Link to them? Out of interest, I promise I won't order from them in solidarity.

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	you can get SAs from a lot of places
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i got from here because easiest for blanks in the colour i wanted
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	What is an SA?
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	I found this. I want to mount one to my desk.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i dunno what it stands for but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they are spherical i guess the S stands for
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's a bowl on top
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Oh it's the name for a physical key type?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	keycap yea
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Of course that's a thing
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	its one of the triangle of great keyboards
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	with key mechanism type and keycap material
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	most keyboards have cherry or oem profile
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	I will probably notice now, but I have not noticed keyboard websites noting the difference between cherry switches and keycaps
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because of the above yea
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	very unlikely you'll find a pre-build keeb with not cherry or oem
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	though there are a few around
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	O I C
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but only from short run stores or places that sell keycaps lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	like drop and stuff
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Wow I never knew what the fuck those letters possibly stood for but now I understand lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	introduce yourself as Hannah, MDA
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	The GMMK Pro looks the goods. I like their key caps too. Very expensive though.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	look i didn't go through 8 years of school to get my SA and MDA to have you talk to me like this
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	That's a bit too forward for someone so low profile
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Blank SA
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	haven't heard of that one
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh the pcmr one
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	DSA or SA are my preferred style
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	the problem with getting anything other than a fullsize or TKL is that buying caps is kind of a pain in the ass
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i want to try a full set of both of those
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i love the retro workstation vibe of the bowl tops
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Pcmr do full sets with additional caps for the weird sizes, but you gotta pay for all 108 keys.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this guy in the local gamedev discord posted a thing with a bunch of info and then i was just like
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Sean
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Bean
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeah you can get full sets but lots of spare keys for a 65%
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and the K6 has an extra key crammed into the bottom row which makes it even harder for this specific keyboard
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im gonna listen to more dido and there's nothing you can do about it
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	ahh I... wanna thank you
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i just got a facebook ad for this

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they're usually half rack units
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	will look something like
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	called midi synths too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	anyway good ones rarely show up on marketplace locally or even au wide but a lot of people have them tucked away
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just putting the word out
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	I once played my mum a midi of a popular song when I was very young, thinking it was cool. My mum told me it sounded terrible and to turn it off.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lmao
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeah bad for covers
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but it can sound great
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	also the windows default midi sounds are garbage which doesn't help
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i made this for a jam using only general midi sounds and you know your mum would hate it but it was a lot of fun

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	sounds sensible
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	if his fake smoke stuff has moisturiser in it its potentially more harmful than the solder fumes lol

698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	yea but like you couldn't tell, it shares the same roof as the house and it's done nice, previous people used it as a bedroom
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so no interior door?
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	no it's seperate, great for working while kiddos are home
698718122076536852	Sigil#7544	also great for locking yourself out of the house

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	you sure do carry a lot of poo and offal for someone who I thought was mainly skilled in data
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so anything to do with paperwork, samples, signatures, getting IP drug stuff delivered etc
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	My thoughts fuckin exactly

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	the database: the human body the coordination: actually just doing it yourself
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Because I‚Äôm technically qualified to handle samples and have the lab accreditation so I guess I‚Äôm just kinda office bitch
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Hopefully I get asked less often to carry samples around now that I‚Äôve melted one irreversibly

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i effectively gave him a 7 hour extension since usually deadline is COB
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	still didn't do it
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	if hes asking at 4.20 pretty much guarantees no handup
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That‚Äôs the equivalent of someone agreeing to send me the PDF investigator site file and instead they mail me a 450page binder when we both confirmed it was paperless process
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	amazing
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	like two weeks later it shows up in paper form

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I found a stamp that says return to sender and I‚Äôve used it liberally

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Today someone is panicking about what ‚Äúoriginal document‚Äù means lol
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	I was watching utopia last night the governments intranet was down so they send emails by having an admin person take the laptop to the recipient
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	there‚Äôs no way to further elaborate, it‚Äôs the original, are people ok
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	then it got complicated with CC
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	That‚Äôs how I get doctors to e-sign things. I walk into clinic with a laptop and make them log in lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	because they can‚Äôt seem to make it happen via their own computer somehow
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	‚ÄúI lost the email‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	There was no email you need to sign in
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Goddammit
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	this is the sort of thing i can never tell my students
212844574534664193	œù·ÑÇŒ£–¶#6272	hard to get ~~good~~ help
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	because i use the line "if you can't follow instructions you won't get a job" a lot
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i know it's patently false
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's convincing sounding
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well it's probably more true in my industry than a lot of others but
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I wish
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh yea
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	You‚Äôd think so considering the huge binding time sensitive legal requirements but they treat it all as optional????!
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	just blame IT
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	‚ÄúPatient must consent before treatment‚Äù 3 weeks later ‚Äúhey I found this unsigned consent form did you know this patient is getting an experimental drug‚Äù
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	We're 6 months behind on data we need to submit to receive funding? It's ITs fault because they only sent us login instructions, not clinical psychology instructions
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Meanwhile they‚Äôve had two adverse drug reactions in those three weeks without any legal protection
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so the computers on campus aren't set up to do android builds, there's some manual steps required on every login on every computer. so i ticketed it to IT saying it would be cool if this could be fixed in the image so we don't have to do it with every student since it's easy to fuck it up
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	turns out there's a document that went out with the specific instructions that got buried in my emails
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	instead of just sending me that document
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	"got buried in my emails" ok boomer
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	IT went to the heads of faculty and complained that teachers aren't following instructions
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeah i mean the email got sent 4 months ago with a bunch of other unrelated documents
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I set up 5 sub-inbox folders for all my communications and have never missed a single one, how is it hard
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Boss emails go to ‚Äúimportant‚Äù externals go to ‚Äúfrom external‚Äù and salhn and corporate go to ‚Äúbullshit sa Heath‚Äù
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Yeah you gotta read the whole email bro
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	everything with an attachment goes to my sub-folder ‚Äúhas attached docs‚Äù
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	well we didn't need to do android builds 4 months ago and the image has changed multiple times since then
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	if I miss something it‚Äôs on me at this point
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	This morning my manager asked me off hand ‚Äúhey do you keep your emails? Can you find one for me‚Ä¶‚Äù
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Do I keep my emails. Asked by manager of clinical trial unit
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	yes
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	lmao
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	tfw you spend 6 months setting something up that ADHA has already set up for all PHNs nationally and you dont find out til you tell everyone its ready to go
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	What was it!!!
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	really easy one-login access to alllll the clinical softwares
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oooohhh
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Smh
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	oh btw apparently someone decided that HVAC controls are under IT's purview
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which already doesn't make sense but also now we can't change the settings on the control panels because someone locked them all
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which i would be behind if our AC setup actually worked properly and heated/cooled rooms evenly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so now the front of the classrooms are at exactly 22 degrees, and the rest of the clasroom is whatever temperature you get because all the vents are at the front
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ffs i got fuckin PRANKED, what I did is still required, ADHA version is for another purpose
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	colleague knew this would freak me out ahhahaa

Barely thirty seconds ago it had been screaming towards Earth at speeds space-based radar couldn't calculate. And now here it was, in all it's spherical glory.** > > Eight kilometers down, a guard jumped out of the main gate, shouting in surprise. The Mikusphere had its eyes open, but its head was bowed in the direction of the gate. The guard said something, then the gate closed and the guard vanished. The Mikusphere continued its course, making its way towards the gate. > > And then it stopped. > > The guard was right where the gate should have been, but the gate itself was gone. There was only a few meters left, but it was too far to get back there. > The Mikusphere moved forward, still going forward. > "What have you done?" a guard shouted. > The ground shook beneath them. The ground shook and made a sound like a grinding stone. > "It's just a small matter," the guard said. "I can't prove anything. If you want to kill me, you'll have to kill me first."

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	> The Mikusphere stopped. The guard was standing on a small stone, his legs dangling at the side. The stone was surrounded by vines that reached up to the very top of the stone. In the center of the stone was a sign that read: > "It is a matter of life and death. The Mikusphere is a dangerous creature. It is a weapon of mass destruction. It will be detonated by the strongest weapon of its kind. Anyone who stands in its path will be destroyed. My people are the only ones who can stop it." > > The Mikusphere continued forward. The guard stopped, standing on the stone. > "We can't let you do this," the guard said. "You're nothing but a bunch of stupid, young people." > "Your people are nothing more than a bunch of idiots, too," the Mikusphere said. "Let's just forget this." > "We can't forget," the guard said. "You're a monster. You're going to kill us all." > > The Mikusphere stopped. It turned and looked back at the guard. It was like looking at a brick wall. It was like looking at the end of a tunnel. > "I'm not a monster," the guard said. "I'm just a man. And I'm going to kill you." > The Mikusphere stopped. It turned and looked at the guard. Its eyes had turned a flaming red. > "I'm not a monster," the Mikusphere said.

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	im doing the audio jam this weekend so i got it to generate me some prompts > The music genre I will make music in is called "Dance Music". Dance Music is a genre of music that is created by electronic instruments and computers. Its beats are very strong and fast. A cool fact about me is that I am good at playing the saxophone. I was in a band in middle school, and I was the only girl in the whole school who played the saxophone. I will create my music by creating a beat with my computer. I will record my beat with my computer, and add in some sound effects like the sound of the ocean. I will also add some vocals to my beat, along with a voice over. I will also make a music video to go along with my song.

231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	I haven't updated the blocklist. I went with what was on there when I set it up.
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	My blocklist has 80k domains. How many does yours have?

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	its worth checking top permitted domains every now and then and try blacklisting shit that doesnt look necessary hehe

231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Traffic was banked up across the intersection on the rundle side and clear on the hindley. Safer than usual tbh.

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe he calls computers in general "Facebook"
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	And he typing questions in the search bar
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	most likely answer

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	For us tech savy folk, probs not. For the gen pop I reckon so.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Sometimes I think the gen pop are miles ahead of me when it comes to things made for the average joe. They might not know how it works, but they know how to use it.

122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	I feel that if you have the inclination to learn more about technology as a whole, you're more likely to keep up with it. Where as I think people in general will get to a point where they go this is too much and then stop.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Collaborative learning on a global scale
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	To be fair TikTok is too much for me because I feel like it's an app that works to reduce your attention span. So I am an idiot.
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Haha that's me, almost. I don't think "this is too much" more like "this is enough"

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	I never got the appeal of snapchat
122254563741794305	Mr. Shadow Stalker#0006	smart move on the tiktok my friend, it is a terrible platform and no one should use it.
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Pull faces at your mates. Show em dogs
254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Unless it was just for nudes (also don't really get) why would you want shit to disappear

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	pretty sure they'd win that fight

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	my thoughts exactly
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i don't think anybody who matters would mind if certain sectors got free travel
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	they should replace the concession card with the free travel card
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I agree bc they gotta check us all individually just let me validate when I get on for free
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's nice that people on low income get cheaper tickets but it doesn't make much sense that healthcare workers get it for free and low income people get it for not-free
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Give blanket free validation card to concession and healthcare workers imo
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Yeah i do feel bad about that

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	40 minutes in to work and Ive lost my shit already
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	This project is being run by a non-IT manager but I'm doing 110% of the work
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	First she launched it before we'd even finished speccing it, so we had to do an embarassing "uh no this doesnt exist yet nevermind"
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	then scope creep went from "for 70 internal staff only" to "pretty much every EMR user aswell" aka 2000+
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	And now, she's sent, TO THE EXEC TEAM, a document detailing how it all works
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	half of it is FLAT OUT WRONG and the other half is imaginary fantastical functionality that doesnt actually exist
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	im fucking furious. This is a person I have a previous good relationship with at a previous job for YEARS and i dont know why shes suddenly a massive thorn in my side
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Oh no
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Ohhhh no
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	anyway, fuck her, no more protecting her
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Ive had to cop it 2 times in front of exec already to protect her. No more
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Anyway I've just sent her a ~1000 word email telling her what she needs to decide on before the meeting she booked for 9.30am
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	Can I just say this is exaaaaccctly how my old boss took my predictive model work and ran with it and literally created a fantasy about it‚Äôs abilities

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	or not? Is it ok to go in to a meeting and calmly state "I am extremely frustrated that this has crept out and out and I think we're not mature enough as a team to launch it."
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	"I am archiving the project and will be available again to discuss in 2022"
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	I‚Äôd do it, I don‚Äôt think anyone benefits from not having the full buy in or feedback from the people building it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	There's two other massively urgent pieces of work going on simultaneously too. Both CEO -> DoH -> we get funding shit
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Im gonna bring that up in the meeting and be like "is your bullshit imaginary project more important than 4m for SPS services in SA? No, fuck off"
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	lol in response to my email she cancelled the meeting

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	This seems insane, have they reduced capacity or are people _actually getting tested_ now
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	theyre legit
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	people are actually getting tested
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	but its unfortunate bc people who are supposed to get their 3 and 5 day tests while quarantining are havin a really hard time getting them done
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	because everyone  and their dog is gettin tested too
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	so theres this weird sub population of people at a propbably greater exposure risk having a hard time gettin the mandated testing

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	idk how its so limited
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Maybe they could do loose appointments

It said acted on within 4 hours, not completed. This has been interpreted by her as completed. This is not the case. I copped the brunt of that.

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	caught some of the suburbs and nearly burned down the highschool
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	I love zelda but they really fucked skyword sword with the motion controls. The switch version is just barely passable.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i thought you can turn them off
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Yeah but it's still based around motion controls.  So for example, you would use motion controls to swing the sword and then control the camera with right thumb stick.  But if you turn them off, you swing the sword with the flick of the thumb stick and then have to control the camera by holding down the R button and use the thumb stick, but then you can't swing because you're controlling the camera.
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	The bird is hard to fly with motion controls, and the gyro needs to be reset frequently.
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	It can be played like Ocarina where you Z target to centre the camera again.
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	But that's old hat.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	who's hungry

254899698588975105	MrSchnookums#8180	Maybe it only ways on weekends when the car park is empty
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Elon doesn't have a clue lol why people still stan

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i provided it with a made up idea so it got the right format
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i said: > For the Game Makers Toolkit Fantasy game jam, I will make a action adventure RPG game about an elf fighting the goblin king, in which you use a grappling hook to soar to great heights, and a bow and arrow to shoot enemies.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	and then i replaced the game jam name and let it make the rest and it gave me
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	> For the Space Game Junkie game jam, I will make a game where you are on a space ship, and you have to shoot at enemies. (This is the same game as the one for the Fantasy Game Jam.)
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	cheeky bastad
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	hahaha
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Speaking of girls, I went to an all boys school my whole life, and as a result, didn't really learn how to talk to girls. I remember deciding to go to a school social where the boys and girls mingled and got to the door and chickened out.
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	This was like, year... 8?
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	damn
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i went to coed schools my whole life and still didn't learn how to talk to girls :deepfriedcrylaughing:
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Hahah
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i had a lot of female friends but all my girlfriends were from other schools
231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	They're spooky man, they go out in public with wet hair and no makeup
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	meeku on fire
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	actually i guess having female friends taught me that the trick to talking to girls is
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	not to differentiate them from dudes haha
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	which i guess only works if you're not dude-gross by default like a lot of teens
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Ive never had any issues talking to girls
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	Still had fuck all relationships tho lol
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what if
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	it's because you had heaps of issues talking to girls
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but you didn't know it
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	well idk they still hung out with me and let me in their house and shit
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just kidding it's because you have an intimidating name
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	rly?

231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	Spooky
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	nah it was probably more due to rotundity and lack of maturity tbqh

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	rotundity hahaha

231996495673425921	dishlex#3951	I remember once arguing with someone who could better penguin walk in front of some girls. They said it was lame.
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	sorry im just imagining a fat ron weasley saying "im not fat im rotund"

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yeah most of mine were like d&d and video game sorta nerds so still lots of common ground just drifted
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	all the mates i had in the "cool" side of things i definitely don't talk to
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ah.. mine were mostly normies
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i was always in that weird bridge position between like sports nerds, musos and geeks

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ok after testing chatbot in the openai playground it's gonna be too expensive
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	since in order for it to be even vaguely intelligent you have to feed it the entire conversation back again
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so the more you talk to it the more expensive it gets

471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	the AI is a dick lol
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	yea open ai queries are expensive
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	really expensive
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	without context and on ada it's not too bad
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but you get really really vaguely relevant responses
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	so not very interesting imo
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	if i can be bothered doing the chat history functionality we can train a markov chain chatbot on our nonsense
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	but she will end up be an amalgamation of whatever the fuck we are
471655925543993345	HotelAlphaNectar#0338	those are fun and easy but also boring bc they dont create new fun
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	yea its less chatting to it and just vomiting garbage that can be mildly amusing

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	i just had a thought why don't you make a pcb as a project
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	ive poked around at it and it doesn't seem too complex
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	would mean a new case too
84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	what case does it use?

226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	sick68 is the project on thingiverse
226653824062849035	Jugsy#6969	ngl as much as I sook about the process I do like the purity of it

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	seems like it would be relatively simple to fit a pcb into the bottom of the case

84291698015891456	Graf Eisen#0039	just need to add mounting hardware
